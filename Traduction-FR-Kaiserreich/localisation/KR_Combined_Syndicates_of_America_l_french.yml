### Reconstruction Focuses ###
CSA_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Reconstruire le Pays"
CSA_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "La révolution américaine est terminée, mais si rien n'est fait, les blessures que la guerre a ouvertes vont continuer à saigner. Nous devons oeuvrer vite pour reconstruire une nouvelle Amérique, plus sociale et plus égalitaire, sur les ruines de l'ancienne."
CSA_social_revolution:0 "La révolution sociale"
CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "Nous avons encore du pain sur la planche pour débarasser l'Amérique de la corruption, du rascisme et du chauvinisme. C'est pourquoi nous allons nous attaquer au noyau de tous ces maux, le système capitaliste lui même, lui et toutes les inégalités l'accompagnent."
CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "Redistribuer les richesses"
CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "Nous ne pouvons plus tolérer un ordre social dans lequel des hommes ne faisant strictement rien d'utile pour la société amassent des millions de dollars pendant que des millons de prolétaires qui travaillent dur leur vie entière ont à grande peine gagné de quoi se nourrir et payer leur loyer. La fin des banques, des entreprises capitalistes et des multimillionaires qui accumulent à outrance est enfin venue."
CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "Un toit pour chacun"
CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "Les propriétaires et les magnats de l'immobilier ont été une peste pour notre pays. Nous allons sortir les pauvres de leurs piteux bidonvilles, à présent que les riches et les puissants ont été dégagés de leurs trônes."
CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "L'émancipation pour tous"
CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "Stupide est l'homme qui fait de sa couleur de peau un argument justifiant son imaginaire supériorité. Des prolétaires de toutes les couleurs et de toutes les croyances ont combattu et saigné pendant la révolution. Le loyal immigrant doit être un citoyen aussi légitime que l'homme qui est né et a vécu en Amérique."
CSA_womens_liberation:0 "La libération des femmes"
CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "Pedant que les hommes mourraient en masse sur le front, ce sont les femmes qui ont fait tourner les usines, produit les munitions et nourri notre révolution! Cela sans même parler des femmes miliciennes, pilotes et bien d'autres encore qui ont donné leur vie pour le socialisme. Leurs souffrances et leurs sacrifices ne doivent pas rester lettre morte!"
CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "L'éducation révolutionnaire"
CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "L'Académie a été la mère nourricière de bien des révolutionnaire, mais le système éducatif en lui mème est toujours intrinsèquement réactionnaire. Il a été bâti dans l'idée de créer des travailleurs bien conditionnés, des capitalistes vicieux et des politiciens sans coeur. Mais tout c'en est fini de tout cela!"
CSA_reconstruction:0 "Le début de la reconstruction"
CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "La guerre civile a mis notre beau pays en pièces. L'arrière pays n'est plus rien d'autre que de la boue et des cendres, tandis que les villes ont été réduites à des amas de ruines fumantes. Nous devons donc dès maintenant et vite oeuvrer à la reconstruction de logements et de nouvelles infrastructures."
CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "Le problème des prisonniers"
CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "Depuis le début de la révolution, nous avons accumulé une énorme liste de prisonniers politiques qui sont en attente de leur procès. Maintenant que la guerre est finie, l'heure est venue de tous les juger. Bien que certains dans nos rangs croient encore en leur réhabilitation, d'autres, plus radicaux, en appellent à une justice révolutionnaire."
CSA_transformitive_justice:0 "La justice transformatrice"
CSA_transformitive_justice_desc:0 "Bien que nous ayons traité sévèrement la vieille élite américaine, il reste un mouvement populaire de taille qui s'oppose à notre nouveau régime. Nous devons pacifier tous les groupes contre-révolutionnaires restants, et être sur de traquer chaque infiltré dans notre camp avant de pourvoir enfin être surs d'avoir gagné."
CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "Le problème de l'AFP"
CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "La bande de réactionnaires démagogues d'Huey Long, des industriels au coeur de pierre et des généraux tyranniques va finalement être jugée. Bien que le "Kingfish" lui-même aie échappé à la prison, nous punirons sévèrement tous ceux qui ont collaboré avec lui, en guise d'exemple."
CSA_destroy_jim_crow:0 "En finir avec Jim Crow"
CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc:0 "Se débarasser des terroristes du Sud ne sera pas seulement une affaire militaire. Nous allons devoir déraciner toute la bigoterie et le rascisme qui empoisonnent l'Amérique depuis bien des siècles, et mettre fin au culte de la personnalité de Long. Nous allons rendre Licoln fier et abattre le vieux "dixie" une bonne fois pour toute."
CSA_equality_for_all:0 "L'égalité pour tous!"
CSA_equality_for_all_desc:0 "La longue bataille pour la liberté et l'égalité semble enfin se terminer. Le vieux système, les vieilles hiérarchies disparaissent dans le lointain et bientôt les injustices de l'Amérique ne seront plus que d'amers souvenirs et quelque lignes dans les livres d'histoire."
CSA_reconstruction_is_over:0 "La reconstruction est terminée"
CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "Les crimes de cette nation ont enfin été lavés, même s'il a fallu pour cela quantités de feu et de sang. Nous avons fait naître un nouveau monde sur les cendres de l'ancien. Une terre ou les travailleurs sont libres et égaux!"
CSA_a_new_america:0 "Une nouvelle Amérique"
CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "Ouvriers, Paysans, nous sommes le grand parti des travailleurs. Nous avons posé des fondations puis reconstruit dessus l'Amérique, pierre par pierre. Elle est notre, et nous saurons y vivre en paix. L'Union fait la force!"
### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
CSA_second_convention:0 "La seconde convention constitutionelle"
CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "L'heure est venue de faire un pas de plus dans notre lutte révolutionnaire, de trouver un moyen d'unir les travailleurs derrière une cause unique. Bien que nos délégués viennent d'une grande variété de communes et de syndicats différents, nous espérons trouver un consensus pour notre futur gouvernement socialiste. Comme ce fût le cas il y a déjà un siècle, c'est Philadelphie qui sera le lieu de cette convention constitutionelle!"
CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "Le Commonwealth Américain"
CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "Nous n'avons pas fait tout ce chemin pour retomber dans la tyrannie, c'est ce que semblent dire les résultats de la convention constitutionelle. C'est le socialisme syndical qui règnera en Amérique, succédant au nationalisme de Bellamy. Nous allons proposer des mesures sociales pour tous les travailleurs et travailleuses de notre nation."
CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protéger le prolétariat"
CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "Tandis que de nombreuses nouvelles idées pour un meilleur système économique ont germé en Amérique, la tourmente de la guerre civile nous a empêché d'en mettre aucune effectivement en pratique. Mais à présent, nous avons le temps et l'opportunité de construire la démocratie du prolétariat."
CSA_empower_councils:0 "La démocratie locale"
CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "Notre fédération ne peut pas être bâtie sur le vieux modèle autoritaire qu'est la démocratie américaine, notre démocratie doit être proche du peuple. Grace à des lois ramenant la politique dans les mairies, relançant le débat public, les décisions politiques ne seront enfin plus un lointain murmure sur la colline du Capitole!"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "Comité des syndicats des métiers"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "Réformer le système capitaliste va être une tâche herculéenne, et l'état seul ne pourra la résoudre. Un congrès va débuter, rassemblant des représentants locaux de tous les syndicats des métiers afin de déterminer le meilleur moyen de profiter de la croissance économique tout en protégeant les droits des travailleurs. "
CSA_councilism:0 "Conseillisme"
CSA_councilism_desc:0 "Maintenir la vieille bureaucratie américaine est inutile. L'un des compromis entre les syndicats artisanaux et les syndicats industriels était l'implémentation de conseils ouvriers décentralisés. Ces conseils permettront aux États d’exercer un pouvoir autonome sur la manière dont les syndicats sont organisés."
CSA_federalism:0 "Fédéralisme"
CSA_federalism_desc:0 "Même si régnaient aux Etats-Unis la corruption et la fraude éléctorale, force est de constater que son administration était une pierre angulaire de notre nation et de notre identité. Une pierre angulaire si bien ancrée qu'il serait stupide de ne pas s'appuyer dessus."
CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "Le pouvoir au peuple"
CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "L'Amérique, peut être pour la première fois de son histoire voit l'émergence d'une vraie démocratie. Pas une illusion de liberté savamment concoctée par des capitalistes avides de profit et des politiques corrompus, non, une vraie démocratie directe pour gouverner notre confédération! Ce pouvoir, le pouvoir du peuple, nous allons l'inscrire dans les amendements de notre nouvelle constitution."
CSA_federalist_economics:0 "Syndicalisme d'affaires"
CSA_federalist_economics_desc:0 "Nombreux sont ceux qui, au sein de la confédération, se défient de l'idée d'un syndicalisme d'affaires, certains imaginant même ça comme une traîtrise à la révolution. Ce qu'ils oublient c'est que depuis 200 ans l'amérique est sous la coupe du capitalisme, et que nous allons avoir besoin d'un modèle économique intermédiaire pour faciliter la transition vers le socialisme. Ainsi, le Congrès a mis fin au contrôle du marché par l’État mis en place sous Reed."
CSA_mutualism:0 "Mesures protectionnistes"
CSA_mutualism_desc:0 "Les conseils d'ouvriers ont conclu qu'il serait sage de prendre des mesures protectionnistes pour protéger l'économie américaine. Il ne s'agira pas de mesures aussi drastiques que celles du "Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act" mais d'une approche plus souple du problème incluant par exemple plus d'allègments fiscaux pour les syndicats qui n'opèrent qu'au sein du pays.
CSA_workers_cooperatives:0 "Les coopératives ouvrières"
CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc:0 "La domination des syndicats industriels ne signifie pas la mort de l'entreprise! Nous allons simplement remplacer les patrons cupides qui se servaient un salaire bien trop élevé et laisser a la place les travailleurs décider pour eux mêmes et diviser le profit équitablement entre eux."
CSA_social_dividends:0 "Des dividendes sociaux"
CSA_social_dividends_desc:0 "Le congrès a adopté une loi instaurant un revenu de base universel, c'est a dire qu'une portion des profits de toutes les entreprises d'état va être redistribuée équitablement parmis tous les citoyens afin de leur permettre de vivre dignement. Nos travailleurs ne sont pas de simples sujets, mais le moteur qui fait avancer notre nation, et il est normal qu'ils aient droit a profiter de la richesse de l'Amérique."
CSA_public_owned_enterprise:0 "Nationalisation!"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc:0 "L'Amérique a depuis longtemps soigneusement évité la nationalisation de ses entreprises, car un nombre conséquent de nos présidents de jadis étaient entièrement acquis a la volonté du captial, devant celle de leurs électeurs. Mais nous avons brisé le joug du capitalisme et le Congrès a enfin légalisé le recours à la nationalisation. Le glas de la propriété privée a sonné."
CSA_american_syndicalism:0 "Le nouveau syndicalisme"
CSA_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "L'Amérique s'est enfin débarassée des exploiteurs capitalistes, et vient d'entrer dans sa première phase de transition vers un meilleur futur. Malgré qu'il en reste au congrès pour railler notre idée d'un 'Syndicalisme a l'américaine', mais il ne peuvent plus se plaindre quand ils voient que nos industries rugissent à l'unisson et que notre peuple célèbre une prospérité jusqu'ici inconnue!"
CSA_unionist_economics:0 "Syndicalisme Industiel"
CSA_unionist_economics_desc:0 "Bien qu'il s'en trouve encore pour prôner une synthèse entre le syndicalisme ouvrier et le syndicalisme d'affaires, il est évident que nous ne pouvons pas faire de compromis avec l'ancien monde. Les syndicats prolétaires industriels doivent former les fondations de notre économie, nous devons montrer que ce sont désormais ces syndicats qui confèrent tout son pouvoir au gouvernement."
CSA_industrial_unionism:0 "La domination syndicaliste"
CSA_industrial_unionism_desc:0 "Les marchés capitalistes étaient tous gouvernés par les principes sacrés de 'l'Offre et la Demande', ainsi que des vélléités des spéculateurs, mais notre nouveau système sera bâti entièrement sur l'économie de la demande avant tout. Le Congrès a en ce sens déclaré que tous les syndicats devaient être enregistrés auprès de l'IWW, sous peine de se voir pénaliser économiquement."
CSA_workers_self_managment:0 "L'autogestion des travailleurs"
CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "L'un des objectifs du Congrès était de mettre fin aux hiérarchies du passé qui imprégnait l'Amérique. Une loi a donc été votée, illégalisant la possession d'une entreprise et supprimant enfin les actions de préférence. A présent les travailleurs peuvent réellement prendre le contrôle des moyens de production grâce au partage des actions ordinaires."
CSA_industrial_democracy:0 "La démocratie industrielle"
CSA_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "La démocratie fait partie intégrante de l'identité américaine. Mais pendant bien trop longtemps, l'Amérique a laissé son manteau démocrate dans le hall de l'usine, les américains y devenants esclaves des tyrans capitalistes. Plus jamais. Le Congrès a mandaté un "Industrial Democracy Comittee" afin de permettre aux syndicats de mieux coopérer pour la démocratie dans les usines."
CSA_agricultural_unions:0 "Les syndicats agricoles"
CSA_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "C'est le secteur agricole qui nourrit notre nation, et nous pouvons en retour donner aux agriculteurs plus d'autonomie. Le congrès a étendu la protection de tous les travailleurs agricoles, le autorisant enfin à se syndiquer et à se joindre à l'IWW."
CSA_syndicalist_economics:0 "Planification décentralisée"
CSA_syndicalist_economics_desc:0 "Les gouvernements locaux, ceux des états, ont apporté beaucoup a la révolution. En coopérant avec leurs voisin et en participant au bon ordre social. Bien qu'un état totalement décentralisé soit un modèle inatteignable, une utopie, c'est le premier pas vers le paradis des travailleurs!"
CSA_protect_the_revolution:0 "Protéger la révolution"
CSA_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "Maintenir et protéger l'esprit révolutionnaire va être un enjeu majeur des années à venir. Nous faisons face à une énorme pression des puissances réactionnaires partout dans le monde, à des sabotages de dissidents dans notre propre pays, ainsi qu'à une opposition politique parfois même dans nos propre rangs. Mais il en faudra plus pour briser notre volonté, la lutte continue camarades!"
CSA_general_defense_comitte:0 "Le Comité Général de Défense"
CSA_general_defense_comitte_desc:0 "Confier le haut-commandement militaire et la sécurité du pays entier à un groupe de vieux réactionnaires ne peut pas être une bonne idée. Notre Commonwealth doit rester méritocratique et exempt de toute corruption, et en ce sens le Congrès a organisé un comité réunissant délégués syndicaux et d'officiers de l'armée afin de redresser le commandement militaire."
CSA_indepedent_media:0 "Protéger la liberté d'expression"
CSA_indepedent_media_desc:0 "Les libertés de la presse et de l'expression sont des droits inaliénables du peuple américain. Le Congrès a réaffirmé l'importance du droit à la liberté d'expression, et ce malgré les nombreux appels à la censure. Laissons les réactionnaires et les conservateurs exprimer leurs idées et nous pourrons alors d'autant mieux les enfoncer dans leurs contradictions, laissons les réactionnaires et les conservateurs exprimer leurs idées, dans tous les cas leur parole sera noyée sous le flot de nos camarades célèbrant l'avènement d'une nouvelle ère de progrès!"
CSA_strategic_services:0 "Comité des Services Stratégiques"
CSA_strategic_services_desc:0 "Bien que le Comité Général de Défense se soit montré plutôt efficace, il a également été critiqué pour être bien trop ouvert au public. C'est une honte de devoir conspirer dans le dos de nos concitoyens, mais nous pouvons au moins assurer que ce Comité des Services Stratégiques sera fidèle a l'esprit de la révolution et sera surveillé de près."
CSA_the_revolution_continues:0 "La révolution continue"
CSA_the_revolution_continues_desc:0 "Grâce à la stabilité qu'a acquise notre gouvernement, notre économie et notre sécurité intérieure, nous pouvons enfin panser nos blessures. Il est certains que les cicatrices de la guerre civile resteront encore visibles quelques années, mais cela ne signifie pas que notre nation est infirme et faible. La lutte continue, le feu de la révolution brûle encore de ses plus belles flammes, et le Commonwealth se dresse tel une force libératrice pour tous les travailleurs!"
### Union of American States Focuses ###
CSA_usas:0 "L'Union des États Socialistes Américains"
CSA_usas_desc:0 "L'autoritarisme progresse, alors que les petites bagarres de la convention constitutionelle on finit par la proclamation d'un gouvernement fort et centralisateur. Les 'USAS' vont monter au monde qu'ils sont capables de reconstruire leur pays et de panser les plaies ouvertes de la guerre civile!"
CSA_lead_the_revolution:0 "Diriger la révolution"
CSA_lead_the_revolution_desc:0 "L'Amérique avant-gardiste est une nation centralisatrice, une nation qui n'est pas sujette des dogmes de l'IWW ou de l'AFL. Nos loyaux syndicats, s'assurant que notre nouvelle union ne se perde pas en guéguerres internes, nous en feront le premier thème abordé par le gouvernement."
CSA_peoples_commisars:0 "Les comissaires du peuple"
CSA_peoples_commisars_desc:0 "Pendant la guerre civiles, beaucoup de milices se sont battues, les communes comme les syndicats adoptant un système de commissaires du peuple. Ces vigilants citoyens ont surveillé chaque éventuelle élément contre-révolutionnaire dans nos rangs. Le Congrès a légalisé ces commissaires, sous contrôle direct de l'état, et on étendu le système à la nation entière."
CSA_control_townhalls:0 "La signature du 'Hall-Ballam Act'"
CSA_control_townhalls_desc:0 "Le manque de loyauté est en train de nous faire perdre la fidélité du Congrès. Pour arranger cela, les camarades Gus Hall et John Ballam ont établi un décret qui oblige tous les élus à déclarer sous serment leur loyauté à l'Union. Cette loi assure la sécurité de tous en permettant de poursuivre les hommes politiques coupables de ttrahisons de tout types."
CSA_politics:0 "Centralisme démocrate"
CSA_politics_desc:0 "Le concept de centralisme démocrate désigne un système où chaque décision est prise par un comité central avant de devoir être approuvée par les élus et les membres du parti. Un comité central, au dessus du congrès, à été élu, et il aura le dernier mots sur la rédaction des lois. Les seuls a avoir a craindre un tel système sont les réactionnaires et les traîtres."
CSA_communist_party:0 "Trop d'élections"
CSA_communist_party_desc:0 "En dépit de la centralisation du pouvoir, il reste des querelles au sein du Congrès. Nous ne pourrons pas progresser tant que l'IWW, l'AFL, le KoL et tous ces acronymes obscurs se chamaillent entre eux. Ne réalisent-ils pas que l'Avant-Guarde est le vrai pouvoir centralisateur, que nous sommes la seule chose qui empêche la révolution de s'auto-détruire. Pour en finir avec ces embrouilles, il faut en finir avec ces élections syndicales à outrance."
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship:0 "La dictature du prolétariat"
CSA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc:0 "Tout ce que nous avons accompli jusqu'ici l'a été par la force et par la violence, la pensée bourgeoise qui s'accroche a l'Amérique comme une moule à son rocher ne peut malheureusement pas être totalement éliminée, mais nous allons tout mettre en oeuvre pour la museler. Car si nous tolérons le passé qui sait ce qui pourrait refaire surface? L'idéologie bourgeoise est une trahison, un crime, et le Comité est le juge."
CSA_fosters_economics:0 "La politique économique de Foster"
CSA_fosters_economics_desc:0 "William Z Foster a réussi à faire passer avec succès ses politiques radicales. Comme écrit dans son manifeste, "Vers une Amérique Syndicaliste." Foster a immédiatement appelé à des nationalisations massives de toute l'industrie et de toutes les ressources naturelles, ainsi qu'a une série de réformes radicales."
CSA_resource_nationalization:0 "La nationalisation des ressources"
CSA_resource_nationalization_desc:0 "L'établissement d'une vraie politique socialiste en Amérique va nécéssiter la confiscation d'un grand nombre de domaines fonciers dans chaque état de l'union, incluant l'ensemble des forêts, des gisements de minerais, des lacs etc. L'Union ne sera bientot plus sous le joug des syndicats."
CSA_union_managment:0 "Protéger les syndicats des métiers"
CSA_union_managment_desc:0 "Les syndicats jouent un rôle de premier plan au sein de notre économie, mais ils n'ont pas la responsabilité de gérer la production, responsabilité qui échoit aux organes économiques du gouvernement. Mais il en faut plus, il faut que les syndicats acceptent d'être surveillés à tous les échelons par le parti, afin de les protéger du désordre administratif et de l'anarchie."
CSA_collective_farming:0 "Green Fields Program"
CSA_collective_farming_desc:0 "Le Comité à approuvé l'application du 'Green Fields Program' pour les millions d'hectares de terres saisis a la révolution. Le Comité a vu en ce programme une solution préférable a la simple collectivisation, car il ramène un certain esprit de compétition et une notion de mérite dans l'acquisition des terres. Ce programme permet de revendre les terres qui ont été saisies ou réservées pour une utilisation publique au plus offrant ou à celui qui promet le meilleur rendement agricole."
CSA_decentralized_planning:0 "L'autogestion socialiste"
CSA_decentralized_planning_desc:0 "Le Comité Central va s'attaquer immédiatement à la tâche difficile de former suffisemment de techniciens et de gestionnaires compétents pour faire refonctionner l'industrie. Les instituts techniques dispérsés et mal organisés, les école de commerce, les écoles par correspondance etc, vont être remis sur pied, étendus et directement mis en lien avec les industries."
CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ:0 "Un syndicalisme centralisé"
CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ_desc:0 "La révolution prolétarienne a initié les changements les plus rapides et ambitieux que tout ce que l'humanité a jamais connu. Les ouvriers et paysans, par centaines de millions, ont brisé leurs chaines d'esclaves et vont construire une société libre et prospère. Le syndicalisme va inaugurer une nouvelle ère pour l'humanité, va construire un nouveau monde."
CSA_browders_economics:0 "La politique économique de Browder"
CSA_browders_economics_desc:0 "Le comte Russel Browder a introduit avec succès une série de réformes dont l'objectif est de mettre en place une économie stable et prévisible. Ces réformes sont principalement fondées sur la planification de l'industrie et le contrôle direct de l'état sur un grand nombre de secteurs de l'économie. De plus ces réformes ont été acueillies positivement par le Comité et les Syndicats."
CSA_price_controls:0 "Le contrôle des prix"
CSA_price_controls_desc:0 "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
CSA_control_unions:0 "Dismantle the IWW"
CSA_control_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the leadership of the revolution, the Vanguard Party. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USAS, the people, see that Vanguardism represents their interests better."
CSA_state_farms:0 "Collective Farms"
CSA_state_farms_desc:0 "The State agriculture organisation is now grouped under the Committee's Commissariat of Agriculture, and is formed into trusts for individual crops and geographical divisions of the industry. Crops are sold either directly to the government, to the cooperatives, or, in a very rapidly lessening extent, upon the open local markets."
CSA_state_quotas:0 "State Quotas"
CSA_state_quotas_desc:0 "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilisation of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles. The Committee has refused the idea of awards for meeting quotes, stating that advancement in the economy should be a reward, not an expectation."
CSA_planned_economy:0 "Browder's Anticapitalist Society"
CSA_planned_economy_desc:0 "Browder's Committee has approved a national plan, which declares a total economic war against the forces of monarchism and reaction. Therefore, industrial decision-making shall be socialized. Exemplar facilities will be observed as schools for uplifting others, while failing facilities will be required to adjust or be liquidated."
CSA_defend_the_revolution:0 "Defend the Revolution"
CSA_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "All the forces of capital and reaction are conspiring to destroy the new order. We face not just a war of ideals, but a war of bloody sabotage and shady subterfuge, one that must be won at all cost. Traitors in our own midst thankfully can be prosecuted."
CSA_revolutionary_guards:0 "Revolutionary Guards"
CSA_revolutionary_guards_desc:0 "Exercising our new authority in order to crush terrorists, counterrevolutionaries and traitors will require the creation of new, well-structured military and law enforcement agencies, not any wayward Red Guards or crazed vigilantes."
CSA_state_media:0 "The Revolution Will Be Broadcast"
CSA_state_media_desc:0 "The Daily Worker, Hollywood, and now the radio have all been seized by the Artists' Congress by the CC's graces. Under the tutelage of such illuminary socialist thinkers such as Hemingway, Welles, and Hughes, all the world will know of the American Socialist revolution."
CSA_create_the_cia:0 "Create the CIA"
CSA_create_the_cia_desc:0 "In order to defeat the class enemies of the revolution, we have laid the groundwork for a Combined Intelligence Agency, managed directly by the ruling committee. A clandestine security organisation that will always have an iron fist or a dagger in the back ready for counter-revolutionaries."
CSA_purge_reactionaries:0 "Purge Reactionaries"
CSA_purge_reactionaries_desc:0 "In no country was culture so debased by capitalism as in the United States. Essentially a gigantic effort to perpetuate the robbery of the workers. Sterile, hypocritical, lifeless. The proletarian revolution in the United States has at once made a slash into the maze of hypocrisy and intellectual rubbish, paving the road for a glorious new America."

CSA_a_gun_in_hand:0 "A Gun In Hand"
CSA_a_gun_in_hand_desc:0 "What more could a man need than a gun? Why a better gun of course! Massed infantry dominates our army and so we should ensure they are as well-armed as possible."
CSA_a_boot_under_foot:0 "Uniforms And Grenades"
CSA_a_boot_under_foot_desc:0 "Our forces so far lack a standard uniform, by adapting a standard set of combat fatigues as well as producing a set pattern of mortars, grenades and machine guns we can keep our boys ready for anything."

CSA_the_first_draft:0 "Implementing Conscription"
CSA_the_first_draft_desc:0 "It seems that despite the enthusiasm for the ideals of the revolution, fewer men than we would have liked have volunteered to leave their homes and families for an uncertain future on the front lines. An executive order from President Reed that a draft be instituted has therefore been drafted"
CSA_creating_cohesion:0 "Political Officers"
CSA_creating_cohesion_desc:0 "Our militiamen are enthusiastic, but they lack an education in the finer points of socialist theory.

CSA_the_long_haul:0 "The Long War"

CSA_disciplinary_standards:0 "Enforce Discipline"
CSA_disciplinary_standards_desc:0 "One of the increasing problems we are suffering is a lack of organisation and frequent insubordination in our forces, to this end we have re-created the Military Police and intend to crack down on those who disobey orders."
CSA_the_second_draft:0 "The Rebel Girl"
CSA_the_second_draft_desc:0 "As the war wears on we find young women in small numbers attracted to the uniform, wearing it we mean. By allowing them to serve on the front lines we can show our commitment to the equality and progress of women in the new America."

CSA_upgrade_the_m1_desc:0 "Production of a new battle rifle, based on a design by John Garand found in the Springfield Armory, should be sped along in order to ensure we have top-class weaponry. We just need to spend some time working out the kinks..."
CSA_baptism_by_fire:0 "Reactivate The Army War College"
CSA_baptism_by_fire_desc:0 "The Army War College in Pennsylvania was closed at the start of the war for its potential to serve as a hotbed of pro-federal sentiment and reaction. Now however we see that there may be some value in making use of its facilities, to educate the officers of the New America."
CSA_reform_the_cavalry:0 "Re-create The Cavalry"
CSA_reform_the_cavalry_desc:0 "The US cavalry was rejected by the revolution as an aristocratic institution and an outmoded one on the battlefield. As the war wears on however we see the need for mounted soldiers who can serve as recon and keep down civil unrest where vehicles and regular police forces are not available."
CSA_standardize_unit_sizes:0 "Standardize Unit Sizes"
CSA_standardize_unit_sizes_desc:0 "Our Red Guard militia forces have done well to take us this far, but their irregular numbers, often simply based on however many willing men can be found in a given town, hamper their ability in the field. By creating a standard unit size and redistributing troops from unit to unit in order to meet it we can enforce some uniformity in our ranks."
CSA_field_canon:0 "The Red Dragon"
CSA_field_canon_desc:0 "The 240mm Howitzer, nicknamed the "Red Dragon" by our troops, is the latest in heavy field guns for use by our army. Traditionally we have failed to make much use of artillery but now we should be able to deploy heavy support whenever our troops need to enter battle against fortified positions."
CSA_motorisation:0 "A Motorised Force"

CSA_reactivate_the_officer_corps:0 "Establish Appointed Officers"
CSA_reactivate_the_officer_corps_desc:0 "While military order has been well-maintained so far reports indicate that many divisions are still electing their own officers.

CSA_the_dust_settles:0 "The Dust Settles"
CSA_the_dust_settles_desc:0 "As the revolution comes to a close and victory seems to be in sight, we must now take stock and evaluate the state of the army comprehensively. Already proposals are flurrying about this project or that to enhance our military might."

CSA_arsenal_of_the_revolution:0 "Arsenal Of The Revolution"
CSA_arsenal_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "While America's army is not the most experienced, our nation is one of the most productive on earth. By allowing the Syndicalist nations of earth to freely borrow gear from [ROOT.GetNameDef] we can supply them with what they need to defeat capitalism."

CSA_anti_armour:0 "Anti-Tank Brigades"

CSA_unleash_the_hellcat_desc:0 "One of the most innovative things the airforce has done is present a design for a carrier-based aircraft known as the Bethpage F6 Hellcat, courtesy of the Bethpage Aviation Union & Design Bureau. The Hellcat would be our most agile carrier fighter to date."
CSA_disband_the_militias:0 "Disband The Red Guard"
CSA_disband_the_militias_desc:0 "The Red Guard militias served us well in the Revolution, but now their time has ended.

### Events ###

## Constitutional Convention ###

csa.1.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention begins"
csa.1.d:0 "Today delegates have gathered from across the country in the city of Philadelphia as the Second Constitutional Convention is convened in order to draft a new and better constitution for America. Initial controversy erupts as the AFL brought their own delegation in spite of orders from the IWW to let them represent the whole of industrial labor. Other interest groups that swore allegiance to Reed have also shown up, including members of the defunct Knights of Labor and National Civic Federation. The most important of these smaller Labor Federations is the Trade Union Unity League. This organization, represented by Earl Browder and William Foster, represent a resurgence of Vanguardism in the States. A small riot on the second day erupted when the International Peace Mission and Southern Tenant Farmers Union were ejected from the Convention. These unions had been neutral during the revolution, and were initially accepted due to their high percentage of black membership."
csa.1.a:0 "Loyalists to the old order are not invited!"

csa.2.t:0 "Socialist Constitution - System of Government"
csa.2.d:0 "The AFL has made a splash in what many had expected to be a landslide victory for the IWW. What was supposed to be an easy article, that of the new Legislative Branch, has drawn a line in the sand. IWW representatives argue that America should be a strictly anarcho syndicalist government with all legislative vested in the industrial trade unions. These unions seek to abolish membership fees, and elect representatives via wall-to-wall bargaining unit elections. The AFL argues that America should be a socialist state with power vested in local Councils of Professional Workers. The AFL claims representatives would be elected via seniority, with full voting rights given to only citizenry that have spent some years paying dues and serving their fellow man. TUUL Representative William Foster spoke in favor of the IWW, stating 'seniority and paying to vote is no different than graft, which is something a vanguard of syndicalism cannot support'. Foster's impassioned speech, if it leads to the IWW's legislation passing, could signal a shift in support for the TUUL over the IWW."

To the surprise of many, Earl Browder of the TUUL dissented, arguing that this discrimination was the result of a corrupt party system, and not an inherent flaw in the U.S. Constitution. To Browder, removing the Supreme Court would endanger the unity of the nation, and lead to more schisms as had happened in the Soviet Union.

csa.7.d:0 "A surge of unaligned delegates has attempted to leave for recess several times to no avail. It appears that the issue of Executive power has met an impasse, and a decision must be made before the delegates starve in indecision. On one side is the IWW, whose plan for a totally anarcho syndicalist government requires there not to be an executive officer. Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Thomas suggests a weak head of state position. The opposition is another cooperation of the AFL and TUUL who wish for a strong face to represent America. A leader without the means, argue they, could never save America as Reed did without power. Norman Thomas has condemned the AFL for what he sees as a 'boulangist coup' perpetrated by the AFL and TUUL to revive the old federal government. John L Lewis of the AFL rises to object, saying 'subordination to the IWW programme is no different than a single party state'. "

The core of the IWW has galvanized into a stricter dogma that pushes for the remaining articles to protect against tyranny of a central government. Demanding protection through the lifetime assurance of union membership and compounding social security with lifelong employment. Several IWW delegates had implied that the AFL has been antagonistic, and would prefer a return to capitalism. In response, the AFL have been swayed by TUUL to emphasize the 'Dignity of Labor' in government. This argument rebukes Industrial Unionism with Craft Unionism, where the right to fair wages for fair work done replaces the IWW's goal of the abolition of wages. Browder again takes the stage calling to protect craft unionism , as it prevents a 'tyranny of the 51% over the 49%' in union elections."

We do admit that Long's plan for welfare was in the right direction, but his authoritarian practice was abhorrent. As Long's family and close associates are now in exile, we'll have to make due with putting the leaders that remain in chains. Francis Townsend has defended the actions of the AFP's core membership, saying that the radical militarism was due to the nature of Southern Populism, not Huey Long-ism. Some in the jury have been swayed, but the final decision is to......"

Representing the business and social interest of the old regime, Morganthau stated that it was only under MacArthur that the mob violence against Jews committed by the AFP was halted.

csa.14.d:0 "Avant-guard art forms are not inherently a political tool, but the artists have shown an overwhelming support for the SPA in 1936. From the surrealists in New York shocking viewers with graphic sex on screen, to the Dadaists who challenge the very concept of popular art. As part of this movement, many of the country thousands of movie theaters have been expropriated to ensure that work of this caliber is not censored by prudish theater owners. They are brightly painted and carrying on board a printing press, government complaint office, printed political leaflets and pamphlets, library books, and a mobile movie theater. Theaters are part of the new revolutionary government to indicate the values and programs to the scattered populace of America particularly the rural regions of the country."

csa.15.t:0 "Art Deco versus Modernism"
csa.15.d:0 "For most of the 1920s and 1930s the Art Deco art style was the dominate style of architecture and from coast to coast buildings were built in the Art Deco style. However, a number of revolutionary architects within the SPA wish to break away from that style and seek a more Modernist style inspired by the designs coming out of France, Italy, or Britain. The AFL have come out in force to counter that Art Deco is an American style that cannot be erased by political whims. The AFL point to Diego Rivera's recent demolition of the Rockefeller Center artwork, after his modification of chiseling the faces of Marx and Lenin over Zeus and Thor were decried as being in poor taste. Which style shall be supported?"
csa.15.a:0 "Preserve Art Deco."

csa.16.t:0 "Debates over Union Membership Fees and Racism"
csa.16.d:0 "What sounded like a simple proposition during the revolution, that of abolishing segregation, has run into numerous potholes. Starting with the debate over whether union membership fees were inherently discriminatory towards black workers. Evidence on both sides appears inconclusive, and most of the unions that were rejected from the Constitutional Convention have protested in favour a maximum union membership fee. These protesters claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW. Then came the union Congressmen from the newly liberated states, who are protesting that forcing integration is a violation of their union rights to collectively bargain. Ultimately the IWW have persevered in Congress, and publicly shamed the new Congressmen and protesters as reactionaries."

csa.17.t:0 "The Rise of Women-Only Unions"
csa.17.d:0 "Since the revolution, more and more women are entering into politics and technical fields. While in certain states the transition to womens' liberation has gone smoothly, in other places the wave is impeded. A national poll has shown the number of womens-only unions have quadrupled in the past year. When interviewed, these Womens-Only Unions claim persistent systematic discrimination in the fields of science and civil service. In the aftermath of this release, the planned Womens' Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of womens liberation. [CSA.GetLeader] has settled the debate by decrying both Womens-Only Unions and the systematic discrimination, arguing that 'there are people to blame on both sides for discrimination'."
csa.17.a:0 "The Revolutionary Man and Woman are equals."

csa.18.t:0 "Redistributing Corporate Wealth"
csa.18.d:0 "One of the few things Reed had agreed with the villainous Long on is wealth redistribution. Reed's wartime rationing has given way to a peace-time legislation to prevent the robber baronies he had fought all his life. This is enacted in the form of his final wishes to Congress, the expropriation of all assets owned by a single person in excess of $10 million USD. [CSA.GetLeader] has taken this one step further to decry the idea of corporations, and has threatened to declare the legal concept of corporations to be illegal. The very next day, the state offices were inundated with hundreds if not thousands of formal requests to dissolve corporations into their component businesses, and applications for new Consortium's in the same breath. It is obvious to [CSA.GetLeader] that this is just a ploy for the robber barons to hide their business practices from the government, and has ordered a moratorium on reclassification until wealth redistribution is over."
csa.18.a:0 "You won't get away that easy."

csa.19.t:0 "Land Redistribution Clashes with local Warlords"
csa.19.d:0 "From the mansions of the Rockefeller, the Morgans, the Carnegies, and the Vanderbilts, to the sharecroppers who run company stores. The land of the United States still belongs to the capitalist. The worst example being Murphy Ranch out in California, which was a hive of Silver Shirt activity during the war, and took months to starve out by our forces. It has been decided by Congress to exercise expropriation on these estates. Many of the southern and western estates have been given over to the local communes and established as as public housing for the people. As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation. One particular tough nut to crack was in Montana, where the initial militia sent in turned traitor, and held onto a large estate for it's warlord owner for eight months before our Red Guard were forced to intervene. The program seems to be working however, so there is no reason to reconsider."
csa.19.a:0 "Who would've thought, warlords?"

csa.20.t:0 "Prisons Overflowing with Reactionaries"
csa.20.d:0 "Nobody could have expected our crime and punishment system would become so overstuffed as to require this decision. The numerous small schisms in the SPA has left our government with it's fair share of detractors, as well as the expected resistance. Thousands upon thousands are being fed, clothed and housed on our dime for their crimes against the people. Our more reform minded are worried that prisons will be a breeding ground for reactionary though, so workingmen should be diverted to work camps. There they will be able to pay back the state for what they stole from the people. Vanguardists believe that we have been too lenient on these traitors, and must execute the traitors of the highest standing in the prisons, as a rebellion is surely about to come. The Catholic Workers Movement strongly disagree, and claim that exile and life elsewhere is the most Christian thing to do."

csa.21.d:0 "A notable professor out of John Hopkins University by the name of John Dewey has been appointed Secretary of Education. In Dewey's eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a per-determined set of skills, but rather the realisation of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. In particular he emphasizes that schooling must include hands-on learning famously stating 'if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind'. Dewey's detractors, notably the Catholic Workers Movement, claim his polities are antagonistic to religious education. Ultimately [CSA.GetLeader] has decided to endorse Dewey's reforms."

csa.22.d:0 "[CSA.GetLeader] and the Attorney General appeared to Congress today to allege that they uncovered a connection between the corporations that supported Huey Long, MacArthur, and the Pacific States. This accusation alleges that business interests in America were behind the degradation of civil politics during the revolution, and in the event of either MacArthur, the PSA or Long winning, the Corporations would be the true power behind the presidency. The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL. It appears that some of the corporations on the chopping block include large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co. Many Congressmen worry that punishing the medical profession will harm the life expectancy of the CSA. An alternate proposal for these corporations to be collectivized and their members rehabilitated and let free."

csa.23.t:0 "Resistance to social changes"
csa.23.d:0 "In an attempt to observe the changes in society that socialism is building. Congress has approved of a roaming documentary to film the new America, so that the world may know our progress. The film was shown to Congress to shock and revulsion, with scenes government propaganda defaced, continued social barring of women from workplaces, and a union representative charging a black worker nearly five times the going rate for union membership. The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted. A minority of Congressmen came to defend the film, claiming that this shows the systematic difficulty in enforcing such revolutionary acts throughout the nation. These unpopular Congressmen were then ejected from the building."
csa.23.a:0 "Reactionaries will be dealt with!"

csa.24.t:0 "Family Code of [GetYear]"
csa.24.d:0 "With the social revolution in full swing, Congress has passed the Family Code of [GetYear]. The Family Code is a revolutionary code that is driven by an ideological desire to wither away the capitalist model of the family to be replaced by a socialist model of the familial free unions based on mutual love and respect.\n\nThus to that end the code included a number of revolutionary changes. It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidized. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, as well as decriminalizing homosexual behaviour. A Committee of Sexology, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, Wilhelm Reich, Harry Hay and Alain Leroy Locke are still locked in debate over how to approach this."

csa.51.t:0 "Presidential Election of [GetYear]"
csa.51.d:0 "The presidential election of [GetYear] is here with much fanfare. As expected, [CSA.GetLeader] is in the lead, but as the government has promised a fair and open election it is anyone's guess as to who will win after the debates and all the campaigning is done. Who will emerge victorious in [GetYear]?"

csa.51.e:0 "This doesn't seem fair and open at all..."

csa.52.t:0 "Power Struggle within the ranks"
csa.52.d:0 "William Z. Foster and Earl Browder have long viewed each other as the enemy to the people, but just as much a stepping block to their own power. As the revolution has come to an end their struggle has taken on new heights. How this shall end, is hard to say. Though some are fearing what will happen should the other be deposed."
csa.52.a:0 "This could be bad."

csa.53.t:0 "Foster Denounces Browder"
csa.53.d:0 "William Z. Foster has denounced President Browder in a public speech. Decrying his methods as tyrannical and called out his position of economic totalism. Calling him a revisionist and that he is turning America into a Degenerated workers' state."
csa.53.a:0 "That traitor will be dealt with."

csa.54.t:0 "Browder Reassigned to Europe"
csa.54.d:0 "Following Earl Browder's denounced of President Foster in a public speech, Earl Browder has been reassigned to a newly-created party position in Europe. This new position, as dictated by President Foster, entails Browder oversee furniture assembly and candlestick making unions that are so vital to our economy. Such an illustrious post demands that Browder not return until his year-long tenure is up. Unfortunately, communication to this international facility is spotty at times, so Browder will no longer be able to coordinate with his party allies back in America."
csa.54.a:0 "Monitor his telegrams as well."

csa.55.t:0 "The Arrest of Foster"
csa.55.d:0 "The reactionary Foster has been declared a traitor and enemy of the people. Evidence has been found out how William Z. Foster is working with counter-revolutionary groups. Thanks to the Hall-Ballam Act, our government is not powerless to stop Foster.

csa.64.t:0 "The Army Restructured"
csa.64.d:0 "A proposal has come out to President [CSA.GetLeader] desk about restructuring the Army. The plan would make sure that the army is loyal to the revolution. However, this is likely to anger many within the army. What shall be done?"
csa.64.a:0 "Leave the Army as it is."
csa.64.b:0 "Commence the restructure."

csa.65.t:0 "Henry Wallace Testifies Against Progressives"
csa.65.d:0 "Following the end of the Syndicalist Revolution, numerous members of the Progressive Party had pledged allegiance to the USAS in a massive show of support. While the public at large was fooled by this display, the Vanguard party is not so easily deceived. President [CSA.GetLeader] has spent the last several weeks building up a case to present to Congress purporting the inherent betrayal of Progressives to the socialist ideal. A gaunt and limping Henry Wallace appeared in a political rally today to denounce the Progressives as 'social klansmen disguised to deceive the working class.' Wallace then joined [CSA.GetLeader] in announcing that he will testify in the upcoming sedition trial against the Progressives, and they assure the public that traitors of this caliber deserved death."
csa.65.a:0 "The revolution will be pure."

csa.66.t:0 "Show Trials"
csa.66.d:0 "A number of trials have been conducted of prominent members, who have shown reactionary tendencies. Most of whom are not aligned with [CSA.GetLeader] are being brought up in these trials. Counter-revolutionaries who wish to reverse the revolution have been found guilty of being the enemy of the people. The most repentant of these reactionaries are now on death row, while the stubborn few are still being pressed for information on their accomplices."
csa.66.a:0 "Reactionaries shall meet their fate."

csa.67.t:0 "Butler's Coup"
csa.67.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened. Smedley Butler has gathered supporters among the unions and marched into Washington, denouncing [CSA.GetLeader] as a tyrant and a dictator. The rest of America watches with bated breath to see what happens in Washington. [CSA.GetLeader] has responded by calling for as many allies in the military, including the Red Guards, to seize the traitorous generals before the revolution dies fighting 'another Macarthur'. The Vanguardist forces, wearing the same uniforms as Butler's forces, have engaged in a chaotic fight in the capital. Through the friendly fire and threatening mortars....."
csa.67.a:0 "Butler's Forces capture the Citadel."
csa.67.b:0 "Butler's Forces are routed."

csa.68.t:0 "Restoring Democracy"
csa.68.d:0 "'Americans did not fight and die in the revolution to overthrow a capitalistic dictatorship only to install a socialist dictatorship. The president, however, corrupted the revolution and tainted it. I have removed him from power, not to make myself a dictator, but to stop a tyrant. A new and free election shall be held within a year's time.' With these words on the radio from Smedly Butler, America was shocked to find that the government had been overthrown. Perhaps, however, some measure of freedom had been restored."
csa.68.a:0 "Democracy Now, and Forever."

csa.69.t:0 "Self Determination in the Black Belt"
csa.69.d:0 "Before the revolution, there were plans by [CSA.GetLeader] to implement an autonomous region within the South for the African-American community. With the ascension of William Z Foster comes a dedication to the dream to create a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress. While the ruling party as a whole supports this, several critics from other parties note that this policy would create an unequal standard for civil rights."
csa.69.a:0 "Self Determination is good for all."
csa.69.b:0 "We can't proceed without support."

csa.70.t:0 "Reactions to the Black Belt"
csa.70.d:0 "The African-American community is split over the Black Belt. On one hand it dramatically increased the number of black Vanguard politicians and in the country overall, as the independent communes required elected officials. On the other hand several non vanguard black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colorblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in laws, or to expand the Black Belt northwards."
csa.70.a:0 "We stand Firm"

csa.71.t:0 "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
csa.71.d:0 "The only person to disgust President Browder more than Huey Long's populism, is Harry Leland Mitchell's betrayal of the unions. The USAS has strategically kept silent over the status of the the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, and has been slowly accruing defectors that refused to leave America. Now this long con has paid off, and a group of trusted Congressmen have smuggled Townsend back into America under the pretense of reconciliation. Townsend was immediately arrested in the first bugged hotel room he stayed in, and has become the main attraction in the largest Union Trial in American history. Townsend's fate was already sealed, but this trial will hopefully discourage any more dissidents within the IWW from thinking any reactionary thoughts."
csa.71.a:0 "Good Riddance to Bad Unions."

csa.72.t:0 "The International Peace Movement disbanded"
csa.72.d:0 "The revolution against capitalism drew a line in the sand. You were either with the union or a scab, that mantra worked for John Reed, but not for Earl Browder. It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the The International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivisation. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of Trade Union Unity League members."
csa.72.a:0 "You're not God, Little Man."

csa.73.t:0 "Foster dissolves the AFL"
csa.73.d:0 "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labor leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labor by adoption industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence, allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labor."
csa.73.a:0 "Good Riddance to Lewis."

csa.74.t:0 "Browder purges The Daily Worker of Reactionaries"
csa.74.d:0 "After months of investigation into the editors of the Daily Worker, President Browder has called for their immediate removal. Citing numerous examples of sub-textual betrayals within the newspaper, including ghost-written opinion pieces mouthing reactionary ideas. Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Daily Worker. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy. All were approved, and thus the mind of America is once again safe from pollution."
csa.74.a:0 "No more crude cartoons either."

csa.75.t:0 "River Rouge Wildcat Strike Turns Deadly"
csa.75.d:0 "The workshops of the River Rouge Plant have been a known hotbed for violent activity. It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes to no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [CSA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."
csa.75.a:0 "It's what Reed would have done."


### General Flavor Event

csa.76.t:0 "Primer of God Save King Billy"
csa.76.d:0 "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save the Kaiser, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save the Kaiser is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."
csa.76.a:0 "Chaplin has out done himself."

csa.77.t:0 "The Catholic Workers Movement"
csa.77.d:0 "While a good number of religious have protested the effects of the revolution, that is not true for all groups. Of these groups the one that has attracted the most attention and popularity recently the Catholic Workers Movement. Lead by Comrade Dorothy Day, the movement has attracted popularity for combining Catholicism with socialist values. They focus on the concept of Works of Mercy as well as have built a number of Hospitality Houses in many major cities and even smaller towns. The Hospitality Houses are acting as support shelters for those trying to return to civilian life now that the revolution has come to fruition."
csa.77.a:0 "Live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ."

csa.78.t:0 "Grapes of Wrath Primer"
csa.78.d:0 "Today the film Grapes of Wrath premiered in theaters today. The film is based on the book of the same name and follows the Joad family, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. It does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more hopeful and optimistic tone and shows the family working to help out with the revolution overthrow their California work camp. The film has been well regarded by both critics and the public as a necessary edit."
csa.78.a:0 "A film for the masses."

csa.79.t:0 "The People's Conservation Committee"
csa.79.d:0 "Since the 1916 National Park Service Act, Americans have been able to preserve natural splendor safe from industrialisation. Since the revolution has now been achieved a movement has cropped up to combine this conservationism with these old Progressive ideals. A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees around Oklahoma, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply. Though it took a lot of convincing to get Congress to fund this project, the PCC hopes that in a few years the dust storms that used to reach Washington D.C will only be a memory."
csa.79.a:0 "Revolutionary Conservationism."

csa.80.t:0 "Revolutionary Memorials"
csa.80.d:0 "With the revolution now over, countless memorials have gone up throughout the country to honour the sacrifice of the men and women that made this possible. While many honour those that fought for the revolution itself, there are also ones honoring the struggles like the Haymarket Square Riot. As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honoring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing, and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and are honoring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."
csa.80.a:0 "Everyone shall be honored, unless they were bombers."

csa.81.t:0 "Cure for Polio"
csa.81.d:0 "Dr. Jonas Salk has created a cure for Polio. This is a miracle cure that many are calling a breakthrough in modern science. The scourge of Polio in America will now be forever gone from the minds of Americans. Parents are lining up in droves at health clinics across the country to get the vaccine for their children and themselves."
csa.81.a:0 "Thank you Dr. Salk."

csa.82.t:0 "Fate of the Boy Scouts"
csa.82.d:0 "A question has come up in regards to the Boy scouts of America. Some within congress regard it as a more reactionary organisation, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end a number within Congress believe that a new Pioneer organisation should be created similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe called the Pioneers of America. Unlike the Boy Scouts, this organisation will be for both boys and girls and supported by the government, and help make sure that the new socialist ideas are passed down."
csa.82.a:0 "Leave it alone."
csa.82.b:0 "Create the Pioneers of America."

csa.83.t:0 "American Artists' Congress"
csa.83.d:0 "The American Artist Congress is an organisation that has been created to unite artistic people around the country and help promote the arts within America. From traditional artwork to film-making all are supported within the congress. It quickly has become a popular organisation to show the new advent-guard art of the revolution. Their Chairman, Ernest Hemingway, has already begun a plan for a series of patriotic publications on life during the revolution."
csa.83.a:0 "Art for the masses."

csa.84.t:0 "John Reed Clubs"
csa.84.d:0 "Throughout the country a number of literature clubs called John Reed Clubs have emerged. They are to help organize writers across the country and promoting reading and literacy through the local communities. They focus on Socialist Literature, and in particular the corpus of John Reed's nonfiction work."
csa.84.a:0 "Reading for Reed."

csa.85.t:0 "Paul Robeson Takes A World Tour"
csa.85.d:0 "The hiatus Paul Robeson took from acting to pursue social causes in the past year has greatly expanded his popularity. With a powerful voice and strong support for international Syndicalism, Robeson has become the Marian Anderson of socialists in America. Just like Anderson before him, he has chosen to embark on a world tour to spread his music and support for African American rights to Europe. His stops include the Union of Britain, Commune of France, and the SRI. These European audiences, while in contact with the wider world, still find the attraction of black singers to be exotic."
csa.85.a:0 "Bon Voyage Robeson."

csa.86.t:0 "Un-polluting the Industrial Revolution"
csa.86.d:0 "In the old days of the Socialist Party, successes were measured by how clean your sewer system was. Especially in Wisconsin, where Morris Hillquit made it his campaign promise to clean up the city. In reforming and organizing public maintenance services, Hillquit showed that socialism could reorganize systems without having to redefine or destroy the foundations of the system. That principle of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation, now that the chains are broken. Many cities such as Pittsburgh are filled with pollution that fills the skies, now that the revolution is over, cities all across the country shall be cleaned up and modernized. We hope the international community can appreciate a clean sewer as much as it does a skyscraper."
csa.86.a:0 "Cleanest Sewers In The World."

csa.87.t:0 "Anthem for the New America"
csa.87.d:0 "Congress is debating what anthem shall become the Official Anthem of the [CSA.GetNameDef]. Several songs have quickly become the candidates to debate. The question is which shall be voted on to become the official anthem of America?"
csa.87.a:0 "Solidarity Forever."
csa.87.b:0 "There is power in a Union."
csa.87.c:0 "This land is your Land."

csa.88.t:0 "Stone Mountain Georgia"
csa.88.d:0 "Within the deep south in Stone Mountain lies a massive bas-relief carving of three Confederate figures, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The site was also the rebirth of Ku Klux Klan. Many wish to remove such a blight, especially as other monuments to the Confederacy are torn down. However, people are divided as to what to do about the relief. Some believe that it should be destroyed. James Ford, in a cynical turn, wishes to chisel down the Confederates and replace them with Jemmy, John Brown, George Padmore. Diego Rivera, the artist behind the renovation of Rockefeller Plaza, suggests a cheap and honorable compromise. The relief is to be re-chiseled down to replace the Confederates with the leaders of Socialist revolution, including Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and John Reed. "
csa.88.a:0 "Destroy the relief carving."
csa.88.b:0 "The Relief shall show the heroes of Emancipation." 
csa.88.c:0 "The Relief shall show the history of Socialism."

csa.89.t:0 "Syndicalist Ethics" #Suicide is legal
csa.89.d:0 "With the onset of a new society, a new set of ethics must take the place of the old ones. What is truly ethical behaviour? Waging revolution by all means. Before the revolution and during the war, life was hard for our fellow Americans. Many had to suffer the loss of a loved one, life-threatening financial insecurity during the crisis years or persecution. This lead to behaviour the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose soul suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretense to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances. The more conspiratorial rightists even claim this is a plot by Foster to legalize murder so long as it looks like suicide. Foster's cabinet has called him in to reconsider, but the ultimate result was....."
csa.89.a:0 "Foster backs down."
csa.89.b:0 "Foster wins them over."

csa.90.t:0 "The USA Trilogy by John Dos Passos"
csa.90.d:0 "Film montage, modernist writing, and the socialist spirit comes together in John Dos Passos's new book U.S.A. The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such an unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of extralegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemmingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by the Congress."
csa.90.a:0 "Calm Hemmingway down."
csa.90.b:0 "Hemmingway is right."

csa.91.t:0 "Union Vacations"
csa.91.d:0 "With the revolution one of the changes that has come is the transformation in terms of vacations. The workers of America rarely got to enjoy all the luxuries that were created and the progressives would say 'belonged to the people'. How many of the struggling masses got to enjoy picnics or visiting the national parks when they had to work as many hours just to survive and feed their children? No longer will this be the case. The various local unions across the country, regardless of which federation they belong to have begun to take over and manage various cultural centres as well as help sponsor vacations. This is supported by the government at both a local level and national level as a way to boost productivity and encourage comradeship."
csa.91.a:0 "Culture belongs to the people."

csa.92.t:0 "The Family and Freedom Program"
csa.92.d:0 "Our workers in the factories need to be free from distractions, our revolutionary soldiers must not be burdened with unnecessary worries about the well-being of their family. As part of the program to ensure that the American worker is relieved of responsibilities which President Foster has termed "A millstone about the neck of the workers" Today the first train from Chicago to the rural plains in the centre of our country has left with children from mothers and fathers who work in important positions in the industrial heartland. The kids will be safe on the countless fields and ranches in the pastures, making themselves useful in farm labor and running errands, living a healthy life. This frees their parents to wage revolution with all their hearts and energy. With the success of this first train, Foster has proposed to his cabinet to make this a mandatory arrangement throughout the USAS, even going so far as to propose that children be taken by force from more stubborn worker families for their own good."
csa.92.a:0 "Foster's cabinet talks him down."
csa.92.b:0 "Foster's cabinet agrees."

csa.93.t:0 "Woody Guthrie Music Tour"
csa.93.d:0 "With Reconstruction on the way famed musician Woody Guthrie and his band the Almanac Singers has gone on a musical tour. Popular with many throughout the country, Guthrie and his band play old classics such as Solidarity Forever and There is Power in a Union but they also have written many new songs, such as This Land is your Land, Ease My Revolutionary Mind, Tear the Capitalists down, and All you Capitalists are bound to lose. The tour has proven to be widely popular in all the venues that he and his band play at."
csa.93.a:0 "Roll the Union on."

csa.94.t:0 "1st World Science Fiction Convention"
csa.94.d:0 "Today in New York City, the first ever world science fiction was convened, gathering literary minds in science fiction to discuss and talk about the genre of science fiction. It had such people as John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Donald A. Wollheim, Frederick Pohl, John Michel, Robert A. W. Lowndes, and Jack Gillespie. While it had a modest size of 200 participants, it was still considered a success with a second one planned next year."
csa.94.a:0 "The World of Tomorrow."

csa.95.t:0 "Indian Revolution Committee"
csa.95.d:0 "The native people of America have long been mistreated by the old Capitalist government. Through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, they stole their land for the to turn a profit. Now that we have done away with the old Bureau government we can address the issue of the Indians. Thus, the Indian Revolution Committee has been created. The IRC will work with the local tribes and communities about how to handle the abuses that the Bureau government did and how the revolution and its ideals can be implemented within their territory."
csa.95.a:0 "The revolution has come to the Native Americans."

csa.96.t:0 "Travel in America"
csa.96.d:0 "With the revolution over and reconstruction underway, a debate over the future of travel has come up. Automotive Unions believe that cars will be the perfect vehicle for the new America, a symbol of the Freedom that Americans fought for. However, the train unions contest that claim and believe that America should invest in trains as a way to help connect all the towns and cities. Who shall Congress support?"
csa.96.a:0 "Support the Automotive Unions."
csa.96.b:0 "Support the Train Unions."

csa.97.t:0 "Alternative to Hollywood"
csa.97.d:0 "With the west still occupied by capitalist reactionaries that has meant that Hollywood is no longer available to us. Thus, the various film and artistic unions have been searching for an alternative and they have presented to Congress a number of alternative locations for filming. Which city shall be given the support?"
csa.97.a:0 "Dallas."
csa.97.b:0 "Miami."
csa.97.c:0 "Houston."
csa.97.e:0 "St. Louis."

csa.98.t:0 "[GetYear] World Series"
csa.98.d:0 "The [GetYear] World Series of Baseball is here. This is the first world series since the revolution and attendance is high. Seven games of Baseball over six days as the Cincinnati Reds fought the Detroit Tigers. The games are extremely close so the final game is anyone's guess."
csa.98.a:0 "And the winner is..."

csa.99.t:0 "Detroit Tigers win"
csa.99.d:0 "The Tigers have won the game. The final game was close but Hank Greenberg, known as the Hebrew Hammer, scored the final home run in the final inning securing the win for the Detroit Tigers and making it so that they won the [GetYear] World Series."
csa.99.a:0 "Go Tigers!"

csa.100.t:0 "Cincinnati Reds"

### Foreign Policy ###

csa.101.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Join the Internationale"
csa.101.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap], having recently become enlightened to the benefits of socialist government, has approached us with a request. They wish to formally join the Internationale. Would such a distant ally be worthwhile?"
csa.101.a:0 "Of course! We welcome them."
csa.101.b:0 "We have no need of them."

csa.102.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
csa.102.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not syndicalist enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
csa.102.a:0 "A poor decision on their part."

csa.103.t:0 "America's Protection"
csa.103.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has decided to offer protection to make sure that our new Commune does not falter in the Pacific."
csa.103.a:0 "Thank you America."

csa.104.t:0 "America's Protection"
csa.104.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has decided to offer protection to make sure that our new republic does not falter in the Pacific."
csa.104.a:0 "Thank you America."




### Military ###

csa.126.t:0 "Boldness in Science"
csa.126.d:0 "From the bold new class of scientists our generation has produced, none can match the imagination of our Oppenheimer and Pasons. Oppenheimer the ambitious physicist with a connection to the brightest minds in the Internationale can make the atomic weapon dream a reality. Pasons the liberated rocketry pioneer whose devotion to socialism is only matched by his devotion to advancing rocketry research. Unfortunately, we can only fully fund one of these due to budgetary concerns."
csa.126.a:0 "We shall be liberated from the earth."
csa.126.b:0 "We shall liberate the atom."

csa.127.t:0 "No Longer Chained To The Earth"
csa.127.d:0 "Despite his unorthodox lifestyle, Jack Parsons has made hasty work of completing a rocket to our specifications. We've had to hold back many objections from politicians claiming that Jack Parsons is secretly in a cult with his work associates. Easily dismissed hogwash, until a meeting held with the team late into production. Parsons surprised everyone with a film of a successful rocket takeoff ahead of schedule, but then dropped a bombshell by asking that his rocket be used primarily for scientific exploration of outer space. This incredible news is still being mulled over by the Committee, with their decision dictating the future of the program."
csa.127.a:0 "Parsons is off, proceed as planned."
csa.127.b:0 "Parsons request is accepted."

csa.128.t:0 "The Atomic Chain Broken"
csa.128.d:0 "An international cooperation resulted in fantastic progress on the nuclear weapon. The biggest hurdle came when none of the Southwestern states would allow a test of such importance on their land, due to public knowledge of nuclear radiation. We've had to settle for an old munitions test site in West Virginia. There the test was made, and the entire Internationale celebrated this occasion."
csa.128.a:0 "We hold the future now."

csa.129.t:0 "America is Liberated"
csa.129.d:0 "At long last all of America is now part of the [CSA.GetNameDef]. The revolution has achieved its a major victory and the people have been unshackled from the chains of capitalism. All our waving the red flag of socialism from California to New York Island. While the scars of the revolution are everywhere we can look forward to bringing the revolution to everyone."
csa.129.a:0 "This land is your land."

csa.130.t:0 "Overtures from [From.GetNameDef]"
csa.130.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has arrived, offering a treaty of friendship between [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef], suggesting that two countries with so much in common should work together rather than be at odds."
csa.130.a:0 "They are wise."
csa.130.b:0 "We have no use for Americans, syndicalist or otherwise."

csa.131.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
csa.131.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to our offer of a treaty of friendship. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new era of co-operation between our nations."
csa.131.a:0 "Excellent."

csa.132.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
csa.132.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer of a treaty of friendship. Perhaps both our nations being part of the revolution is not enough for them."
csa.132.a:0 "A poor decision on their part."

csa.150.t:0 "Illinois General Assembly Invites the IWW"
csa.150.d:0 "The state legislature of Illinois has invited the IWW to discuss the current crisis and the looming deadline issued by the federal governmnet. Jack Reed accepted this offer, and held an informal meeting with several trade union leaders prior. Reed made it clear that the situation was dire, and the SPA would need to unite behind the IWW in order to survive the coming conflict. This silent agreement meant that the traditional SPA leadership would be reorganized along Industrial Unionist lines, with each union representative allowed a single vote. The SPA immediately and unanimously pledged their support for a social revolution through direct action, not diplomacy."
csa.150.a:0 "So Say We All!"

csa.151.t:0 "Jack Reed Declares the [GetMonth] Revolution "
csa.151.d:0 "In the Illinois General Assembly, Reed delivered a firey broadcast describing the wealth of America and the Syndicates. Declaring that direct action against capitalist society was a vital necessity for all Americans, and that the federal government's deadline must not only be ignored it must be defied. Telegrams from the Third International poured in to support Reed's SPA, exciting the attendants. A vote was called to begin reforming the American capitalist economy into an anarcho-syndicalist economy. This referendum, signed by the attendants, declared the Federal Reserve null and void. The IWW was appointed the labor chamber for the new syndicalist government, and the selling of comapny shares declared illegal. The representatives, satisfied with thier success, have returned to Chicago to organize the armed revolution."
csa.151.a:0 "E pluribus unum."

csa.152.t:0 "General Strike Moves on the Federal Reserve"
csa.152.d:0 "The General Strike, whose goal has been to protect workers from federal tyranny, now moves to seize the means of production. The Red Guard have ordered an evacuation of lower Manhattan, in order to both seize the gold in the Federal Reserve Bank as well as dismantle Wall Street. In this delegation were reporters, who were allowed to watch congressmen carry safe boxes away for safekeeping in Chicago. These items are put under the trust of the IWW, whom have elected Norman Thomas as their under-secretary. Several SPA politicans were arrested in Washington D.C for meeting outside the Eccles Building, ordering the Federal Reserve Chairman Eugene Black to hear their petitons."
csa.152.a:0 "Release those men now!"

csa.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"
csa.153.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Across the part of the country controlled by Reed's supporters, Red Guards have been raised in large numbers and a growing determination to see the country remade in a syndicalist image by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they see no path to compromise."
csa.153.a:0 "It is only a matter of time."

csa.154.t:0 "Reconcile with the CSA?"
csa.154.d:0 "Against all odds, [CSA.GetNameDef] has triumphed against all opposition, radically transforming America overnight. From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centered around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at is core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of a peaceful reunification. While our government is favourable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical, and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, the [CSA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's Union State crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed, before the victors turn their eyes towards California."
csa.154.a:0 "Yes, let us end this ruinous war. (Play as the CSA)"
csa.154.b:0 "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

csa.155.t:0 "America is Reunited!"
csa.155.d:0 "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
csa.155.a:0 "From Sea to Shining Sea!"

csa.156.t:0 "No Reconciliation"
csa.156.d:0 "With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, many in [Root.GetNameDef] hoped the rebel government to the west would prove amenable to a peaceful end to the conflict that's ravaged America. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they have bitterly denounced the Revolutionary Congress as a hollow mockery of democracy, no better than the tyrants in Washington and New Orleans it had replaced. It seems that once again, force of arms will be needed to reunite the shattered pieces of the country."
csa.156.a:0 "America one day shall be reunited."

### Resistance Events ###

csa.200.t:0 "Longist Bombing"
csa.200.d:0 "Supporters of Huey Long and his ideals have targeted factories, railways, and troop installations throughout [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. The National Guard are on the scene in [attack_state.GetName], and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind these groups than they were before."
csa.200.a:0 "We shall crush these terrorists."

csa.204.t:0 "Federalist Bombing"
csa.204.d:0 "Federalists who still fight for their delusions of capitalism and exploitation have targeted factories, railways, and troop installations throughout [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives.

#CSA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

CSA_SMEDLEY_BUTLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In 1898 'The Fighting Quaker' Smedley Darlington Butler lied about his age and enlisted in the Marine Corps to join the American force in the Spanish-American war. Due to his high education level he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo following basic training. He didn't manage to see combat as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899.\n\nHe was later transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh while trying to rescue a fellow marine, for which he earned a brevet promotion to captain.\n\nAfterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana wars, first in Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and then in Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya and the capture of Coyotepe Hill. He took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and was promoted to Major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion. He'd be transferred back to the United States, where he served garrison duties until being promoted to Brigadier General in 1921. In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension in the Hoover administration. When the situation started to deteriorate, Butler decided to resign from his post and presented his services to the Socialist Party, becoming the highest ranking military official to join the Red Guard and earning the rank of Field Marshal."
CSA_EVANS_CARLSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 26, 1896, in Sidney, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a Congregationalist minister, Evans Carlson began his military career in 1912 when he left High School and signed up for the US Army as a private, serving in the Philippines and Hawaii, and finishing his four years of service in 1916 as a Sargeant. He then rejoined the Army right during the start of the Punitive Expedition where he took up a garrison job in Mexico. He then signed up for an officers' course, from where he graduated as a second Lieutenant in 1917, and even did a short term in the Artillery corps, becoming an Artillery Captain in 1918. However, he was unsatisfied with his army positions, so he signed up in the Marine Corps in 1922 as a private, regardless of his previous postings. He was quickly promoted to Second Lieutenant, and served in a Marine outpost in Quantico, Virginia. He then sailed towards Culebra, Puerto Rico, in 1924 and remained there five months before being ordered to the West Coast for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Applying for aviation training in 1925, he went to Pensacola, Florida, for instruction, but subsequently returned to duty with ground units. He served another tour of foreign shore duty from 1927 to 1929 at Shanghai, China. He later returned to America and was quickly sent to Nicaragua to fight against Sandino's insurgency, earning a navy cross after facing around 100 rebels with just 12 marines. He also received a commendation after the 1931 earthquake and for his work as Chief of Police of Occupied Nicaragua. He returned to the US in 1933, and was sent to Shanghai, to the Marine Detachment in the American Legation in the Legation Cities, serving as Adjutant and studying Chinese. He returned to Quantico in 1936, attending the Marine Corps Schools while also taking a course on International Law and Politics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.. As the Nation spiralled into chaos, Smedley Butler began probing the Marine Corps for signs of dissenting opinions, and quickly found an ally in Evans. When the time finally came to join the Chicago Syndicalists in their fight, even despite being severely torn, Carlson decided to follow Butler and is now one of our Highest Ranking officers, and Butler's most trusted General."
CSA_MAURICE_ROSE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 26, 1899, in Middletown, Connecticut, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Maurice Rose, born into a Jewish family, lied about his age to enlist in the Colorado National Guard in 1916 with the hopes of being able to join Pershing's Punitive Expedition to Mexico, but was discharged six weeks later for being underage. He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923, and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanisation officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armored warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard. After having been recognized by Butler, he was promoted to the rank of General, and is widely considered the main mechanized warfare expert in the Syndicates' army\n\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He hasn't pledged his allegiance to any of the CSA political factions, and he's rumoured to only be in our army in order to fight the anti-semitic officers of the AUS who once hindered his career."
CSA_MILTON_WOLFF_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 7, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Milton 'Milt' Wolff, born into a Lithuanian-Hungarian immigrant family and previously an art student, joined the Red Guard as soon as it formed. Despite holding more Vanguardist views, he was accepted into the ranks, and became quite popular amongst his peers for his leadership during the clashes against the AFP militias in late 1936 and early 1937.\n\nOnce Jack Reed announced the Revolution, it became immediately apparent there was a major lack of command staff available to the CSA, and it was in this void that Wolff was promoted to General following a vote held by his peers and colleagues who saw him as a good fit for the role. However, his ability to lead large armies has yet to be put to the test.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Centralist Faction, aligned mostly with Browder."
CSA_EDWARD_CARTER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 26, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Edward Allen Carter Jr. was born to a Black American father and an East Indian mother, who shortly after his birth moved to India. With the collapse of the British Empire, and the proclamation of the Bharatiya Commune, Carter came into contact with socialism for the first time as a child, although it was short lived as his parents would move again in 1932, this time to Shanghai, where he tried to join the local American garrison, only to be rejected on account of his young age.\n\nWith the American Civil War brewing in the distance, he travelled to America as a stowaway in one of the Legation's transports, reaching Seattle and joining the local branch of the Red Guard. As their numbers discreetly mobilized eastwards to start the revolution, Carter slowly became popular amongst the soldiers, retelling the stories of bravery and revolution he had seen in his infancy in East India. When the Revolution finally started, Carter was voted in as a General, becoming the one of the only black members of the CSA staff along with Oliver Law.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Federalist Faction."
CSA_GEORGE_H_CANNON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 5, 1915, in Webster Groves, Missouri\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Ham Cannon attended the Culver Military Academy before entering the University of Michigan in 1934 to become a Mechanical Engineer. In Michigan, he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps program, with the specific purpose of joining the Marine Corps. It was there he further developed his knowledge of warfare. However, the outbreak of the civil war disrupted his training and his studies. With many of his fellow classmates being recruited by the Syndicate Red Guards, Cannon decided to follow them into the Red Guard. As the officers were voted to fill the staff of the syndicates, Cannon was chosen as a CO of Michigan's divisions. After a short inspection of the available candidates by Smedley Butler, Butler selected Cannon personally to be promoted to General and has been trying to help the young officer perfect his Marine officer training."
CSA_BENJAMIN_KATINE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 7, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Benjamin Katine, a mechanic and electrician of some renown in New York, joined the Industrial Workers of the World militias as soon as they started recruitment. Becoming popular amongst the the automobile unions, he was voted as an officer in February 1937, and was chosen by the Central Staff as a general. Despite the Automotive unions backing his position, Katine still has a lot to learn before becoming a valuable general for the CSA\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Unionist Faction."
CSA_JAMES_PATRICK_MURPHY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 9, 1901, in San Francisco, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W James Patrick Murphy graduated from the California State University in 1926 as a Radio Engineer and moved to San Francisco. While he was unremarkable in the major unrest of the 1930s, he joined the Red Guard after the 1936 election, where his mechanical expertise with radios allowed him to connect the workers of California with those of Chicago. As the workers were discreetly mobilized into Chicago, Murphy was assigned to several cities across what now is the Syndicalist stronghold, improving radio communications between the Red Guard detachments. For his service, he was granted the rank of General within the Red Guard, but even many within the CSA General Staff doubt this Radio Engineer will be capable of leading vast armies across the American landscape."
CSA_JOHN_TISA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 6, 1914, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W John Tisa comes from a Cuban-Italian immigrant family. Previously working mostly as a factory worker and as an amateur writer in his spare time, Tisa joined the Red Guard the 31st of December, 1936. Since then, he has earned the respect of the Syndicalist soldiers in New Jersey, and was voted as their CO at their staff elections. Tisa was then promoted to general, where, for better or worse, he will have to learn from scratch the art of warfare if he hopes to come out ahead of the enemy during the revolution."
CSA_HERBERT_HOLDRIDGE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Herbert Charles Heitke was born in a German immigrant family, and would sign up for West Point in 1913, graduating in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He was first assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve in Georgia, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant in 1920 and Captain in 1923. In 1925, while he was still in the Reserve Corps, he transferred to the Cavalry corps and was assigned as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point. In late 1929, he was transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and remained in this position until early 1937, earning the promotion to Colonel in 1934. As soon as street violence began escalating, Heitke decided to resign and move back to New York with his family, signing up for the local Red Guard, where his military experience granted him a promotion from Smedley Butler himself. Now a General of the Syndicalist Army, Heitke has become, along with Maurice Rose and Smedley Butler, one of the few military generals of the US Army to join the revolution."
CSA_OLIVER_LAW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 23, 1900, in Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Oliver Law enlisted to the US Army in 1919 as a private, serving with the 24th Infantry regiment stationed on the Mexican Border. He left the military in 1925 after being refused any kind of promotion on the basis of his skin color, moving first to to Bluffton, Indiana, where he worked at a cement plant and then shortly thereafter to Chicago where he drove a cab for the Yellow Cab Company. When the Great Depression hit, Law was left unemployed for years, until he managed to become a stevedore and joined the International Longshoremen's Association. With his savings, he tried to open a restaurant in 1932 but ultimately failed and unemployed once more, he joined the International Labor Defence. With a Civil War looming over the United States, Law was amongst the first to volunteer for the Red Guard. Because of his military background and leadership skills, he was quickly voted in as an officer by his fellow soldiers, before later reaching the rank of General thanks to the sponsoring of the National Negro Congress.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Loyal Member of the Unionist Faction, and he is rumoured to keep close relations with both Bayard Rustin and Asa Philip Randolph."
CSA_ROBERT_H_MERRIMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 17, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's PhD program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Reed's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command, and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.\n§YImportant Notes:§W-It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress. He has an academic interest in Syndicalist economic policy, but his distaste for authoritarianism has alienated him from the more centralist faction of the Congress lead by Browder."
