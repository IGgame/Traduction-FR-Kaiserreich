### Events

 centro.001.t: "Founding of the Central American Congress"
 centro.001.d: "Socialists from all over the country are coming together to determine the future and foundations of the united socialist Centroamérica! The most prominent are the ones who resisted the hardest against the various military dictators and enemies of socialism, but not all can reach the top as they might wish they can. We'll see in the coming weeks just who manages to make themselves known."
 centro.001.a: "To a new future!"

 centro.002.t: "Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
 centro.002.d: "The Partido Nacional Revolucionario has been founded by Sandino, and is gathering a small group of Guatemalans under his cause, leaving his previous partner Moreno out largely on his own. They desire a unified Central American Identity and wish to spread this identity and the revolution to more of Latin America. Many are calling Sandino a monster for leaving Moreno, who was key in his revolution in Nicaragua in the dirt, but his popularity is still steadily rising."
 centro.002.a: "The splits begin to show."

 centro.003.t: "Partido Maximista"
 centro.003.d: "Venancia Callejas has formed the Partido Maximista. His vision is that of a strong chairman, who leads Centroamérica forwards into a bright future, spreading his vision of socialism across Latin America. With his main and only real base of support located in Honduras, he is seen as an unlikely candidate to actually come out on top in the future of our new nation, but he claims he 'Just may surprise us'."
 centro.003.a: "A very dangerous party indeed..."

 centro.004.t: "Partido Sindicalista"
 centro.004.d: "The Partido Sindicalista, led by Agustín Martí, is founded on the ideals of European Syndicalism, created by the Brits and the French. They want to provide a government by and for the people; a safe place for future generations and especially natives, as a large amount of their base of support comes from the indigenous population located within our union. Besides overall native support, Martí enjoys admiration in his home country of El Salvador which sees him as their liberator."
 centro.004.a: "The European model could work after all..."

 centro.005.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.005.d: "The Partido Popular, led by Silverio Ortiz, wants to take a moderate point. Making sure that people have food in their belly and get the education they need. Seen by some as too moderate, and might encounter resistance from people who believe they don't follow true Socialism. Serving as a Guatemalan based party, they hope to ensure the Maximistas cannot wrestle control even if they don't win, claiming they are a greater threat then the military dictators before them"
 centro.005.a: "A man of the people!"

 centro.006.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.006.d: "The Partido Popular, led by Rafael Caleron, aims to save his people from a lack of plenty, wants to implement a better healthcare system. To nay-sayers, accusing him of catering to liberals, he says that his unique form of moderate socialism will keep the country intact, running and alive!"
 centro.006.a: "A man of the people!"

 centro.007.t: "Moreno, Lost and Found"
 centro.007.d: "With Moreno being left in the dust by Sandino, Moreno has been looking for a new home in the political spectrum. Many predict he is going to be forced into subordination under Sandino, but others think he could stab him in the back for his betrayal and join the Guatemalans in the Partido Popular. Anything is possible, but he decides to side with..."
 centro.007.a: "He sways them to the Partido Nacional Revolucionario!"
 centro.007.b: "He makes Partido Popular sound quite appealing!"

 centro.008.t: "Calling of the Congress"
 centro.008.d: "Representatives from all over the country have arrived and are getting ready to start the grand debates in a week!"
 centro.008.a: "Let us begin."

 centro.009.t: "Status of Power"
 centro.009.d: "Congress or the Chairman. Some argue that power should never lie with one man, others argue that any nation needs a figurehead, who can lead them during the dark times. After many days of debating, the parties have finally agreed on an answer."
 centro.009.a: "The congress will always remain important."
 centro.009.b: "The chairman is the final factor."

 centro.010.t: "Status of the Army"
 centro.010.d: "An union of nations brings forth a few problems: each had their own army, their own structure. Should they all be incorporated into a singular large force, a professional army, or should they remain separate, a band of militias spread throughout the country and working more autonomous?"
 centro.010.a: "The militias are our own roots!"
 centro.010.b: "Maybe it is time to create consolidated army!"

 centro.011.t: "Status of Industry"
 centro.011.d: "While the industrial revolution is far behind us, we have yet to entirely switch over. Some call for this to never change, and to focus on becoming the Socialist Breadbasket, ensuring full bellies. Others propose a more radical change for industrialisation, arguing that less people need to work in the fields these days and more can work in the factories, producing luxury goods and arms!"
 centro.011.a: "For a stronger future, industrialisation!"
 centro.011.b: "For a better people, agrarianism!"

 centro.012.t: "Status of the Future Elections"
 centro.012.d: "If the people are working in the factories and the fields, they cannot concern themselves with politics, at least, that is what the Maximistas and Sindicalistas are reasoning. Others argue that no matter what, the people must vote, because is them who they are representing. Otherwise, what are they but impostors for the revolution!"
 centro.012.a: "The council is the backbone of the union."
 centro.012.b: "The people are the true deciders here!"

 centro.013.t: "The Maximistas have won!"
 centro.013.d: "The results are in! The Maximistas have proven themselves as the victors of the elections, and have already begun to implement their controversial reforms. With this, we can expect a centralisation of power resisted by other socialist cliques."
 centro.013.a: "Victory!"

 centro.014.t: "The Sindicalistas have won!"
 centro.014.d: "The results are in! The Partido Sindicalista have found itself on top in the congress, and have already begun to take office under Martí. Loud cheers can be heard from those who want Centroamérica to play a larger role in socialist politics and especially from the native population. What comes next however, is yet to be seen."
 centro.014.a: "For Socialism!"

 centro.015.t: "The Revolutionaries have won!"
 centro.015.d: "The results are in! The Partido Nacional Revolucionario has come out on top within our nation, as many seemed to expect. Sandino has always been a popular choice among the people due to his initial success in Nicaragua, and many expect it to be not so different now. What lies next in his political career is yet to been, but many look on in anticipation."
 centro.015.a: "For the Revolution!"

 centro.016.t: "The Moderados have won!"
 centro.016.d: "The results are in! Seen as socialist as you can get without entering the liberal camp, the Moderados wish to see the people be the main decider within our new union over petty politicians, along with ensuring their safety and everyday needs be met. Other politicians look on in contempt at what they see as filthy moderates, but today the people are the ones who rejoice."
 centro.016.a: "For the people!"

 centro.017.t: "Deadlock!"
 centro.017.d: "After weeks of debating the congress hasn't been able to make a clear winner. Another vote will have to be held, hopefully now with a clearer result. Who wins the new result?"
 centro.017.a: "The Moderados."
 centro.017.b: "The Maximistas."
 centro.017.c: "The Sindicalistas."
 centro.017.e: "The Revolutionaries."

 centro.018.t: "The Capital Debate"
 centro.018.d: "A new nation requires a, possibly, new capital. We must decide if we want to move our capital to a new location, more fitting to our new government, or if we will stay put. In the end, the new congress decides and their choice left the doors just now!"
 centro.018.a: "San Salvador will do nicely."
 centro.018.b: "Tegucigalpa will do nicely."
 centro.018.c: "Guatemala will do nicely."
 centro.018.e: "Managua will do nicely."
 centro.018.f: "San Jose will do nicely."

 centro.019.t: "Our Funding?"
 centro.019.d: "We cannot rebuilt a country on just promises.\n\nFrom somewhere we must get the funding for our extensive projects. We can open our own coffers, but we have more bills to pay, so if we want to avoid spending even more money, we could appropriate some factories from their owners to give us some more assets to use, however, it won't make people that happy."
 centro.019.a: "We will have to open the coffers."
 centro.019.b: "We can just borrow some factories."

 centro.020.t: "Cater to the 'dirty' Moderados?"
 centro.020.d: "There are some in our midst that think we should sympathise more with the other factions, and try and include their ideas into ours. Others call this idea filthy, and call those who hold them 'dirty' moderates. We could try and be more inclusive, giving us a bit of stability, at the cost at angering the current Moderados, or we could just ignore them and try and expel the people that would argue for this!"
 centro.020.a: "They're called dirty for a reason."
 centro.020.b: "We rule for everyone!"

 centro.021.t: "Finally, Prosperity!"
 centro.021.d: "Our new policies have paid off! Our hard work trying to improve the living is paying its dividend, but we are far from done yet. While we can focus on the whole nation, it might be better to focus on a single state. This might anger some of the states left behind, but will result in larger improvements..."
 centro.021.a: "Focus further on Guatemala."
 centro.021.b: "Focus further on Nicaragua."
 centro.021.c: "Focus further on El Salvador."
 centro.021.e: "Focus further on Honduras."
 centro.021.f: "Focus further on Costa Rica!"
 centro.021.g: "Focus on the whole country!"

 centro.022.t: "Hard work pays off"
 centro.022.d: "The work we have done months ago finally pays off. The people in [CEN_prosper_state.GetName] rejoice as we today open the new factories!"
 centro.022.a: "Ah, the fruits of labour."

 centro.023.t: "Sandino's followers"
 centro.023.d: "More and more people flock to Sandino's words, not befitting of a socialist nation...\n\nThey call themselves the Sandiniastas, and have been becoming more vocal in their support of Sandino instead of the government. We must decide whether to stop this in its tracks, or to let him go on and risk this growing out of our control..."
 centro.023.a: "Curb his growth!"
 centro.023.b: "Let him have his fun!"

 centro.024.t: "Resistance to change"
 centro.024.d: "Process does not come without sacrifices. We must purge all non-Hispanic influences that are currently holding us back. There has been some resistance to our advances.\n\nWe could silence them and push through our way, or we could listen to them, and take it a bit slower..."
 centro.024.a: "They will have to live with it."
 centro.024.b: "Maybe we should listen."

 centro.025.t: "Central American Hispanicisation"
 centro.025.d: "Centroamérica has been making worrying strides towards Hispanicisation, forcing marriages to be broken, expelling immigrants and banning any tradition that is not part of the Hispanic culture.\n\nMany in our nation are watching with weary eyes towards the south, and awaiting a denouncement..."
 centro.025.a: "Denounce it."
 centro.025.b: "Not our issue."

 centro.026.t: "The problem up north!"
 centro.026.d: "For too long we, as Centroamericans, have tolerated [MEX.GetName]. Now that they have donned an authoritarian cap, we can no longer stand for that. We must strike soon, for otherwise we might find ourselves at the losing end of a war with [MEX.GetName]..."
 centro.026.a: "We can prepare for WAR!"

 centro.027.t: "Sandino's cult grows"
 centro.027.d: "We have been careless, and the Sandiniastas have been gaining more and more followers...\n\nWe can still act, and ban the organisation, but it will cost us greatly, and anger Sandino even more. However, if we don't, Sandino might get ideas and try and pull even more power towards him self, bringing danger to the revolution.\n\nWe must decide quickly!"
 centro.027.a: "He is too powerful now..."
 centro.027.b: "Let us root him out for the last time!"

 centro.028.t: "The Native Question"
 centro.028.d: "There have been people in these lands for a long time. The natives have been looking at the new congres s, not sure what to think. A representative came to us a few days ago, looking for a statement on their status.\n\nIf they would still be respected and seen as full citizens? We gave them a swift answer: "
 centro.028.a: "We welcome new and old residents!"
 centro.028.b: "We have no need for you!"

 centro.029.t: "The Central American Identity"
 centro.029.d: "With us welcoming the natives with open arms, relations have warmed up a good amount. A group of natives has taken initiative and formed the Central-American Identity. They are spreading the thought that we are all Central-American, not Guatemalan, Nicaraguan or El Salvadorian!\n\nThis will surely bring greater unity to our nation!"
 centro.029.a: "We stand for all Central-Americans."

 centro.030.t: "European Trade"
 centro.030.d: "If we want to improve our trade and go beyond our own continent, we will have to make connections within Europe. We will send out trade ambassadors to try and find a nation willing to establish trade ties and hope that once one nation has been swayed, more will follow!"
 centro.030.a: "Lets Establish Trade routes."

 centro.031.t: "The Moderados resist!"
 centro.031.d: "Members of the Moderados are taking to the street, protesting to our recent policies. They claim that we are taking away free speech, not representing the true revolution and more preposterous claims which they could never prove!\n\nHowever, the are still disrupting public life and we must decide what to do?"
 centro.031.a: "We rule, and we rule alone."
 centro.031.b: "Maybe we should tone it down a bit."

 centro.032.t: "The Revolucionarios resist!"
 centro.032.d: "Members of the Revolucionarios are taking to the street, protesting to our recent policies. They claim that we are taking away free speech, not representing the true revolution and more preposterous claims which they could never prove!\n\nHowever, the are still disrupting public life and we must decide what to do?"
 centro.032.a: "We rule, and we rule alone."
 centro.032.b: "Maybe we should tone it down a bit."

 centro.033.t: "The Sindicalistas resist!"
 centro.033.d: "Members of the Sindicalistas are taking to the street, protesting to our recent policies. They claim that we are taking away free speech, not representing the true revolution and more preposterous claims which they could never prove!\n\nHowever, the are still disrupting public life and we must decide what to do?"
 centro.033.a: "We rule, and we rule alone."
 centro.033.b: "Maybe we should tone it down a bit."

 centro.034.t: "The Moderados are plotting a coup..."
 centro.034.d: "One of our infiltrators in the Moderados has brought shocking news...\n\nThey are plotting a coup against us! These enemies of the revolutions are trying to undermine our attempts are bringing glory to this nation! These rats must be driven out of this country, before these moderates bring our downfall...\n\nBut... more Centroamerican blood is not something we desire to spill, so what direction shall we choose?"
 centro.034.a: "Let them try their best!"
 centro.034.b: "We must work together!"

 centro.035.t: "The Coup"
 centro.035.d: "The day started calmly, with Callejas working at his desk. Soon the doors busted open and armed men rushed into the room.\n\nSoon Callejas was in cuffs and led out of the building.\n\nThe army officers were working together with the Moderados to coup the Maximistas and ensure that the enemies of the revolutions would be taken down and a government loyal to socialism would be installed.\n\nThe nations communications were swiftly taken over and the same message was broadcast all over the nation: "
 centro.035.a: "A new light shines at the horizon!"
