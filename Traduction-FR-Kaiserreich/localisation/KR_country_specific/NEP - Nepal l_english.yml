### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_TRIBHUVANA_DESC: "King Tribhuvan ascended to the throne of Nepal at merely five years of age. Tribhuvan, however, was born king in name only, in reality, the boy-king was nothing more than a figurehead for the powerful Rana family. As he has grown into a man, Nepalese politics have become increasingly defined by the antagonistic relationship between the king and the Ranas. Time alone will reveal the victor of the struggle both politically and economically."

### Events ###
 nepal.10.t: "Nepal Winning the War"
 nepal.10.d: "Impossibly, the Nepalese Gurkhas have streamed out of the mountains and are turning the tide against us. Perhaps the time has come to give in to their demands and sue for peace?"
 nepal.10.a: "Yes, let's end this now"
 nepal.10.b: "No, we can still turn this around!"

 nepal.11.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace with Nepal"
 nepal.11.d: "Amazingly, the Nepalese army has outmanoeuvred us. [From.GetNameDefCap] has sued for peace and given into their demands, to at last put an end to our humiliation."

 nepal.20.t: "Stalemate in War with Nepal"
 nepal.20.d.claims: "Our war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Perhaps we should sue for peace - they can give us our claimed territories and walk away now, and we will abandon our efforts to conquer them. Surely they know that, given enough time, we would win... but at what cost?"
 nepal.20.d.noclaims: "Our war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Perhaps we should sue for peace and just walk away from this, before the battle drags on for too long."

Surely [NEP.GetNameDef] knows that, given enough time, we would win... but at what cost?"
 nepal.21.d.noclaims: "The war with the Nepalese has ground down in the mountains, territory they are far too adept at fighting in. Envoys from the [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us and asked that we sue for peace - the [Root.GetFactionName] would surely win in the long term, but at what cost? They say the war isn't worth pursuing further."
 nepal.21.a: "Then let's end this now"
 nepal.21.b: "The war doesn't end until Kathmandu falls"

 nepal.22.t: "Peace with [From.GetNameDef]?"
 nepal.22.d.claims: "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has ground down in the mountains, as we knew it would, but we are a long, long way from victory.

 nepal.22.d.noclaims: "The war with [From.GetNameDef] has ground down in the mountains, as we knew it would, but we are a long, long way from victory.

 nepal.22.b: "Absolutely not!"
