cend.1.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] envoie une ambassade"

 cend.1.d.GUA_socialist: "With the success of the socialist-Unity coalition, we have managed to escape the grasps of both Ubico and Orellana against all odds.

 cend.1.d.GUA_liberal: "Since we have achieved greater democracy, our liberal friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have approached us to establish closer ties. This is a grand gesture, one we cannot ignore. We must cooperate with our friends to further democracy in the rest of Central America."

Hopefully this can mean closer cooperation between our nations into the future."

 cend.1.d.HON_liberal: "After successfully holding our first truly open elections, our democratic friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to establish closer ties.

 cend.1.d.NIC_socialist: "As we have managed to survive through the storm of American occupation and Central American crisis, we are a highly desired ally among revolutionaries within Central America.

The liberals who have betrayed us so many times in the past, the military dictators who have hurt us, and the foreign oppressors who support them. It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
 cend.5.d.liberal: "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them. The liberals who have betrayed us so many times in the past, the military dictators who have hurt us, and the foreign oppressors who support them. It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"
 cend.5.d.military: "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them.

 cend.6.t: "Formation of the Liberal Pact"
 cend.6.d.socialist: "A 'Liberal' Pact has been founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]!

Furthermore, they claim that the Pact will be a bastion against socialist revolutionaries. We must prevent them from endangering our revolution!"
 cend.6.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! it is designed to bring together the liberal countries of Central America to resist the evil growth of military dictatorships and socialist revolutionaries. Those who join it will defend each other and make sure that its members remain democratic."
 cend.6.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! They aim to bring together what they call the liberal nations of Central America. They however are unable to see that they are just weak-minded and weak-spirited. We must prevent them from mustering a coalition to topple our regime."

 cend.6.b: "It's time for true democracy!"
 cend.6.c: "You can't beat military democracy!"

 cend.7.t: "Formation of the People's Vanguard"
 cend.7.d.socialist: "The crooked dictatorship of [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. They seek to insulate themselves from revolution by working together with other dictatorships! We will not allow this. We must prevent their coalition from taking shape and we must work hard to prevent them from ending the revolution in Central America. If they get what they want, all our work may be for nothing!"
 cend.7.d.liberal: "Because robbing their own people of their freedom is not enough, [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. It is aimed to protect themselves from any outside challenge to their rule. We know that such an illiberal pact will soon fail, but we must make sure they do not permanently smother the torch of liberty in the rest of Central America. We must do everything we can to prevent them from attacking our democracy!"
 cend.7.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the People's Vanguard! Just like us, they prefer a stronger type of government and for that reason, there are many who are jealous and seek to topple our governments. They seek to end this by working together to defend Central America from the rising tide of revolution."

 cend.8.d.liberal: "Our work has not been for nothing, as [From.GetNameDefCap] has joined the Liberal Pact! Together we will be stronger than alone and together we will be able to defend our shared values and our democracy. Together we can protect what is ours from the military dictators and socialist revolutionaries who wish to take it from us."
 cend.8.d.military: "Our friends in [From.GetNameDefCap] have joined the People's Vanguard. We no longer stand alone in our struggle to contain the revolution in Central America. We will work together with them to prevent any kind of spark from threatening the stability of our rule. Together, we will be even stronger as the liberals and socialists are isolated."
cend.8.a: "Ensemble pour la victoire !" 
 cend.8.b: "The torch of liberty stands strong."

 cend.9.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] nous Pétitionne"
 cend.9.a: "[CEN_petition_accept_option]"
 cend.9.b: "[CEN_petition_refuse_option]"

 cend.9.d.socialist: "We have been petitioned to join the Revolutionary Front, the pact founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]! They have asked us to join them in their revolutionary struggle to help rally the men and women of Central America to truly liberate us all. They say that we can only resist our oppressors together. If we are united in this pact, we now we have to decide whether or not their struggle is also ours."
 CEN_petition_accept_socialist: "Together for victory!"
 CEN_petition_refuse_socialist: "Victory will have to be sought after on their own."

 cend.9.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has asked us to join the Liberal Pact. Its stated aim is to further liberalism and democracy in Central America. United in a military pact, we would deter any opportunistic socialist revolutionaries and military regimes to try and attack our democracy.

 CEN_petition_accept_liberal: "For liberty! For the people!"
 CEN_petition_refuse_liberal: "Liberty belongs in one country, not many."

 cend.9.d.military: "We have been petitioned by [From.GetNameDefCap] to join the People's Vanguard. They state that in this violent era, no regime is safe and that only by working together to safeguard stability can we efficiently resist the rising tide of liberalism and socialism. They say that without cooperation, the countries of Central America will one by one fall to revolution. We must decide whether it is worth it to join their cause."
 CEN_petition_accept_military: "Cooperation is key in desperate times."
 CEN_petition_refuse_military: "We can stand on our own."

 cend.10.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 cend.10.d.socialist: "[From.GetNameDefCap] have agreed to join our pact. We now stand together with them in our revolutionary struggle to liberate Central America! Not only are our forces united and will we be better prepared to wage war on our enemies, but our spirits are united as well, something which will undoubtedly help advance the revolutionary mindset of our country! Hail to our new brothers and sisters!"
 cend.10.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join the Liberal Pact. They have made an excellent decision, as together we can create a lasting impact on our corner of the world and safeguard democracy for generations to come! United, we will make sure that the torch of liberty will not be extinguished. We will protect them and they will protect us."
 cend.10.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a wise decision and have heeded our petition. By doing this, we will make sure that together we will fight against the liberals and socialists who seek to topple our rightfully installed regimes. We fight for the people, more than the revolutionaries ever will. With the help of [From.GetNameDefCap], we will keep the revolution at aby."
cend.10.a: "Ensemble pour la victoire !"
 cend.10.b: "We'll come out on top."

cend.11.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] refuse"
 cend.11.d.socialist: "The cowards of [From.GetNameDefCap] have denied our petition. Instead of joining our forces in order to empower the revolution, they have decided to deny us and go their own path, thus betraying our revolution. But our spirits are strong and even without the help of our fellow Central Americans, we can take a stand against our oppressors. We will not let their refusal to cooperate affect us."
 cend.11.d.liberal: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our petition! This is unfortunate, as we cannot be sure that freedom will remain in their country. They are vulnerable to the opportunists of this world and we do not have their support in our own struggles to come. But we are not weak, we have the power to protect ourselves, even without them and we will not forget our goals of preserving and spreading democracy!"
 cend.11.d.military: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a mistake by refusing to join the People's Vanguard. They and they alone will feel the consequences as we will stand strong in the People's Vanguard to keep the revolution at bay. Without them we still have the strength of our people to resist those who seek to topple our governments. We will not give up."

### EVENTS ###
cendem.1.t: "The Confederacy is Born!"
 cendem.1.d: "With the traitors dealt with and Central America held by our forces, we can now safely proclaim the Confederation of Central America. The dream of our nations unified under a democracy formed from each member nation is now no longer a remnant of the past. However, there is still a long way to go. As our territorial extension has grown significantly, our government has decided to delegate the executive power of the newly formed nation to the Central American Constitutional Convention until the new parties reorganise to take into account the newly acquired territories, and will decide upon the fate of the Central American Confederation once the parties with most members present themselves in the convention."
cendem.1.a: "Long Live the Confederation!"

cendem.2.t: "Formation of the Partido Unionista"
 cendem.2.d: "The Partido Unionista, born out of the many parties in Central America who wanted the unification of the continent, has held its first meeting in Ciudad de Guatemala. Having prepared for the unification of Central America for years, they have been the first party to present itself to the convention, and has taken over power temporarily until the other parties organise and the convention regarding the direction the country should take is held.\n\nPresided by the Guatemalan politician José Perfecto Azmitia González, the Unionist Party follows a conservative mindset and has already stated in their manifesto that their objective is to carry the Confederation to a more usual form of Republic and to create a Central American identity, that encompasses all the cultures within Central America. They also reject the intervention of foreigners in national affairs, and this might spell the end of the UFC influence in the country..."
cendem.2.a: "The First of many parties, hopefully."

cendem.3.t: "Formation of the Partido Unificacion Democratica"
 cendem.3.d: "The Partido de Unificación Democratica has held its first meeting as an official party of the Confederation. The meeting, held in the Honduran city of Tegucigalpa, has united the many free-market liberals that feel antagonised by the autarkical proposals of Sacasa, and have released a manifesto regarding the policies they are willing to pursue. Among them, cooperation with foreign companies like the UFC and to open Central American trade to the world. However, they claim they don't want to rely on any specific foreign power, as they see this as one of the reasons why Central America was thrown into chaos when the United States fell into the fires of Civil War.\n\nUnfortunately, not all issues have been solved during the meeting, as a faction lead by the Honduran undisputed face of liberalism, José Ángel Zúñiga, faces off opposition from a faction lead by the Nicaraguan José María Moncada. In order to solve to proclaim a party leader, the Democratic Unification Party has decided to call for an internal election amongst affiliates, and the winner will lead the party in the upcoming elections."
cendem.3.a: "José Ángel Zuñiga stays as the solid popular choice."
cendem.3.b: "Jose Maria Moncada comes ahead in the party polls!"

cendem.4.t: "Formation of the Partido Liberal"
 cendem.4.d: "As the political landscape of the Central American Confederation is starting to take shape, another party has surfaced to challenge the Unionistas in the next election. The Partido Liberal has been officially founded in Managua, with the old Nicaraguan liberal Juan Bautista Sacasa as its head, has become an official party of the Confederation. The Liberals, promising economic independence for Central America and to move away from the old agricultural export-based economy towards an industrial based one. Despite this premise, they have stated that they are more than willing to cooperate with foreign companies in order to achieve this goal, which has eased unrest amongst foreign investors, particularly from the United Fruit Company that feared that their assets might be seized."
cendem.4.a: "The flame of Liberalism continues to burn in Central America!"

cendem.5.t: "Formation of the Partido del Trabajo"
cendem.5.d: "As parties with grand ambitions like the Liberales or the Unionistas start their political campaign, the Partido del Trabajo has been formed in San Salvador, the many centre-left politicians and thinkers that, while agreeing in many aspects with the other parties, are more focused on helping the struggling peasants in Central America than in grand ambitions of prosperity. Amongst the many changes that the Labour Party wants to bring about to the confederation is the establishment of some form of welfare state, a land reform and the creation of a middle class, which is nearly non-existent in our country.\n\nHowever, despite bringing together many parties from different countries, it is unclear who shall lead the party during the elections, as orthodox social democracy, represented by the faction lead by Francisco Sequeira Moreno, clashes with many who follow Arturo Araujo's 'Vitalismo', a variant of Social Democracy created by the Salvadorian politician Alberto Masferrer. Elections for party affiliates have been called and the winner will represent the party in the convention and during the next elections."
cendem.5.a: "The Rose will take root in Central America with Araujo's ideals."
cendem.5.b: "The Rose will take root in Central America with Moreno's ideals."

cendem.6.t: "The Constitutional Convention Starts"
 cendem.6.d: "Without a recognised central authority, managing to arrange a constitutional convention between representatives of all the newly founded parties has been difficult. No consensus could be made over which city should the convention be held, so the city of San Salvador was eventually chosen as its geographic location was near the centre of the Confederation, the city had the infrastructure to held large scale political demonstrations and it was also the symbolical place for Central American independence, as it was the place where the Primer Grito de la Independencia came to be. As the delegations arrive, proposals come forth regarding what the Confederation should look like in the near future, and the convention members have the duty to decide what shall be the future of the country."
cendem.6.a: "We welcome you all."

cendem.7.t: "Debate on the fate of our enemies"
 cendem.7.d: "Before the convention decides on any matter regarding the constitution, it has been deemed wise by the Unionistas to start the constitutional convention by discussing what will be done with the radicals that set out to destroy democracy in Central America. While it is clear that the death penalty is out of the question by all members of the convention, they still need to decide on a fitting punishment for the radicals. The PUD has proposed to exile the leaders and any who doesn't recognise the Federal government as legitimate, which is seen as the most lenient solution, but one that lets many criminals just walk freely. The Unionistas simply propose to imprison them for the rest of their life, which, while being a rather simple solution, could pose danger for our nation in case of a breakout. The Partido del Trabajo, on the other hand, has offered a proposal where the criminals can be imprisoned, but they can choose to work in improvised construction squads, which shall be vital during the reconstruction and improvement of our country, in exchange for reduced sentence times. Before the Convention moves forward, this matter will have to be settled, for the sake of the short term stability of our nation."
cendem.7.a: "The proposal by the Partido de Unificación Democratica is the right one."
cendem.7.b: "The Unionistas have a point, these criminals must not walk freely!"
cendem.7.c: "The criminals should be allowed to earn their forgiveness!"

cendem.8.t: "Executive power debate: The Power of the President"
 cendem.8.d: "One of the major concerns brought up, specially by the Salvadorian PT delegation, is how giving too much power to the president might be detrimental to the confederation in the long run, and so it should have its power reduced to have the congress be able to overturn a presidential decision on a two thirds majority, and they argue that it would otherwise open up the chance of an authoritarian regime rising. However, Unionistas argue that a strong executive power is needed to held the confederation in place, as the ineffective rule of the previous Confederation was what led to its eventual dissolution. After several days of debate, the convention members are once again ready to vote on the matter."
cendem.8.a: "The President will have absolute veto power."
cendem.8.b: "The Congress will be able to overturn a veto with a two thirds majority."

cendem.9.t: "On the Subject of Constitutional Supremacy"
cendem.9.d: "As the national constitution is starting to take shape, we have to decide on the role this document will take on our union. While the convention could install a constitutional supremacy clause in the document, rendering all local legislation useless if it contradicts the constitution, the Partido del Trabajo representatives argue that it would reduce the provincial autonomy to a dangerous level while empowering the Federal Government. Instead, they propose to use the constitution as a guideline for the local legislations, which shall operate freely as long as they respect some core tenants of the Federal Constitution. What should the convention choose?"
cendem.9.a: "The Constitution should take precedence over any pesky provincial law."
cendem.9.b: "The Constitution should serve as a guideline for the local legislations."

 cendem.10.t: "Centralise the Capital?"
 cendem.10.d: "One of the main issues brought forth by the Liberals is that a confederation should try to keep its members on equal footing, and with the convention about to choose a definitive capital for the nation, they have put forth a proposal to split the three powers of the republic to different cities in order to symbolically decentralise the nation. Should the convention members consider their proposition?"
 cendem.10.a: "No, Centralise the Confederation."
cendem.10.b: "Yes, Split the powers to different cities."

cendem.11.t: "Choosing a Capital"
cendem.11.d: "After the rejection of the liberal proposal, it is now time to decide which city shall be the capital of our newly born nation. Among our choices are the old Guatemalan capital of Ciudad de Guatemala, which was the birthplace of the first confederation; San Salvador, the place where the First Cry of Independence took place more than a hundred years ago; Tegucigalpa, the original capital of the Central American republic back in 1880; and Managua, the old capital of Nicaragua and one of the greatest cities in Central America. As the convention members retire from the presidential house of San Salvador to rest until the next round of talks, the radio announces that the new capital is..."
cendem.11.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.11.b: "San Salvador."
cendem.11.c: "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.11.e: "Managua."

cendem.12.t: "Choosing an Executive Capital"
cendem.12.d: "After the acceptance of the liberal proposal, it is now time to decide which city shall be the executive capital of our newly born nation. Among our choices are the old Guatemalan capital of Ciudad de Guatemala, which was the birthplace of the first confederation; San Salvador, the place where the First Cry of Independence took place more than a hundred years ago; Tegucigalpa, the original capital of the Central American republic back in 1880; and Managua, the old capital of Nicaragua and one of the greatest cities in Central America. As the convention members retire from the presidential house of San Salvador to rest until the next round of talks, the radio announces that the new executive capital is..."
cendem.12.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.12.b: "San Salvador."
cendem.12.c: "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.12.e: "Managua."

cendem.13.t: "Choosing a Judicial Capital"
cendem.13.d: "With the executive capital chosen, the convention now has to choose a judicial capital, which shall be the place where the supreme court will be placed."
cendem.13.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.13.b: "San Salvador."
cendem.13.c: "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.13.e: "Managua."

cendem.14.t: "Choosing a Legislative Capital"
cendem.14.d: "After the Executive and Judicial capital cities have been chosen, we now have to decide which city shall have the Senate and most of the legislative body will be placed."
cendem.14.a: "Ciudad de Guatemala."
cendem.14.b: "San Salvador."
cendem.14.c: "Tegucigalpa."
cendem.14.e: "Managua."

cendem.15.t: "Status of the Armed forces"
 cendem.15.d: "After the defeat of the many military reactionary elements that once kept our citizens under their boot, we now have to decide what to do on the force that once gave them the power to end what once were free nations. It is recognised by all parties that a national security force is needed in order to secure our sovereignty, but each party has a different approach towards the armed forces. The Unionistas have proposed a Federal Army, subordinated to the Federal executive power and with a section under the direct control of the President, which would try to strive for professionalism and superior tactics where it was possible. The Partido del Trabajo has come up with a different proposal, aiming to create regional army structures, similar to those from before our nation was formed, they propose a confederation with individual armies which would come together in case of war, but would otherwise have very little executive power and be subjected to each province's executive power rather than the federal government. The Partido Unificación Demócratica has offered a middle ground, with a federal army backed by regional militias, similar to the system that Brazil has with their army. Once again, the convention members will take a vote in order to decide the future of our armed forces."
cendem.15.a: "A Confederate Army with limited power is chosen as the best option."
cendem.15.b: "Compromise is an art as old as politics, and it proves successful once more."
cendem.15.c: "A Federal Army will secure Central American interests once more."

cendem.16.t: "Provisional Cabinet Formation"
 cendem.16.d: "La dernière décision du Conseil sera de désigner un Président provisoire jusqu'à ce que la première élection puisse avoir lieu. Tous les partis ont proposé leurs représentants pour remplir le rôle jusqu'à ce que la volonté populaire puisse décider qui dirigera le pays. Alors qu'un président provisoire est choisi par la Convention, les élections ont déjà été officiellement prévues pour bientôt, donnant aux représentants provisoires suffisamment de temps pour assurer la disponibilité des isoloirs, et des bulletins de vote dans tout le pays."
cendem.16.a: "It is a temporary solution that pleases everyone."

cendem.18.t: "Formation of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
cendem.18.d: "Born from the ashes of what remained of several socialist movements in Central America, the Partido Nacional Revolucionario has formed today in Quetzaltenango. Lead by the Guatemalan Silverio Ortiz, the party is a rather moderate variant of socialism compared to old school socialists like Sandino or Martí, who have been banned explicitly by the other parties from the elections. The party has been forced to take an oath to the other parties as to not associate with the radicals who once plunged Central America into chaos in order to allow their participation in politics. Their platform of land reform, welfare for the working class and better rights for natives has attracted unexpected support and despite the defeat of socialism in Central America, they PNR might still become a relevant force in the Confederation."
cendem.18.a: "Only time will tell if they'll be a strong as they once were."

cendem.19.t: "The [GetYear] Central American Snap Election"
 cendem.19.d: "As the ballots are prepared in every city and town within our nation, our citizens wonder who shall be the party that shall lead the nation for the next four years. As the day nears its end, the ballots are counted and the result is..."
cendem.19.a: "The PT led PT/PNR coalition gets the popular vote!"
cendem.19.b: "The PL led PL/PUD coalition comes out victorious!"
cendem.19.c: "The PUD led PUD/PL coalition takes the win!"
cendem.19.e: "The PU led PU/PL coalition wins by a landslide!"
cendem.19.f: "The PNR led PNR/PT coalition makes a comeback!"

cendem.20.t: "The [GetYear] Central American Election"
 cendem.20.d: "As the ballots are prepared in every city and town within our nation, our citizens wonder who shall be the party that shall lead the nation for the next four years. As the day nears its end, the ballots are counted and the result is..."
cendem.20.a: "The PT led PT/PNR coalition gets the popular vote!"
cendem.20.b: "The PL led PL/PUD coalition comes out victorious!"
cendem.20.c: "The PUD led PUD/PL coalition takes the win!"
cendem.20.e: "The PU led PU/PL coalition wins by a landslide!"
cendem.20.f: "The PNR led PNR/PT coalition makes a comeback!"

cendem.30.t: "Internal Elections of the Partido del Trabajo"
cendem.30.d: "After many years of near hegemony in the ruling party, both Moreno and Morales have been relegated to secondary party work as the popularity of the two Guatemalans Arevalo and Arbenz skyrockets within the party. Both offering a unique take on the party's policies, they don't seem to agree on a common ground for the future. It is because of this that an election has been called to decide who shall lead the Partido del Trabajo for the years to come."
cendem.30.a: "Jacobo Arbenz."
cendem.30.b: "Juan Jose Arévalo."

cendem.31.t: "Internal Elections of the Partido Liberal"
cendem.31.d: "During the recent years, as liberalism has spread in the Central American nation, Sacasa's nearly unchallenged hegemony within the Partido Liberal is nearing its end. The recent polls had been indicating an ascendance in popularity of the Salvadorian Alfonso Quiñonez Molina, a controverted figure in Central America since he had been responsible for setting up a political dynasty in El Salvador, filled with corruption and abuses. However, he has been cleaning up his name for years, and his promises are slowly swaying the liberals away from Sacasa. Calls for an internal election within the party have been plenty in the recent time, and Sacasa has complied with the demands. Now the internal election shall decide who will lead the Liberals for the near future."
cendem.31.a: "Sacasa retains his position as leader."
cendem.31.b: "Molina takes a surprise victory!"

cendem.32.t: "Internal Elections of the Partido del Trabajo"
cendem.32.d: "Excusing himself about his old age and overall exhaustion of politics, Arturo Araujo has decided to step down as the leader of the Partido del Trabajo in order to retire permanently from public life. As one of the last original Vitalistas leaves the public life, the party has called for an internal election in order to decide who shall be the new party leader from now on. While Francisco Sequeira Moreno is still a relevant figure within the party, the young Honduran medic Ramon Villeda Morales has become more and more relevant within the party to the point of being a prime candidate for the election. As the party counts the ballots of the internal election, the results are..."
cendem.32.a: "Ramon Villeda Morales takes a surprise victory and succeeds Araujo in the party."
cendem.32.b: "Francisco Sequeira Moreno is rewarded for his patience and succeeds Araujo in the party."

cendem.33.t: "The Death of Sacassa and the aftermath in the Partido Liberal"
cendem.33.d: "Tragedy has struck the liberal party as Juan Bautista Sacasa has passed away in Managua. With his death, the Liberal party is thrown into chaos as there wasn't any specific leader that could take over after Sacasa's death. The party has called for a new internal election that shall chose the new face of the Liberal party for the years to come and who shall honour the legacy of Sacasa and the many liberal thinkers before him."
cendem.33.a: "Abelardo Cuadra takes a surprise victory."
cendem.33.b: "Molina becomes the new leader of the party."

cendem.34.t: "Jacobo Arbenz becomes the leader of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
cendem.34.d: "After being defeated in the PT's elections, Jacobo Arbenz met José Manuel Fortuny, a young socialist who had been impressed by Arbenz's proposals in the Partido del Trabajo. As both became close friends, 'Che Manuel' offered Arbenz to join the Partido Nacional Revolucionario, where, despite not sharing the overall socialist ideals most members of the PNR have, he has gained an immense amount of popularity and respect due to his compromising nature and concern for the welfare of the citizens throughout Central America. With the PNR's elections taking place, Jacobo Arbenz has won the popular vote by a large majority, and will become the new leader of the party for the next elections."
cendem.34.a: "Was the PNR moved further right? or Arbenz further left?"

cendem.35.t: "The Death of Molina"
cendem.35.d: "Alfonso Quiñonez Molina has passed away in his homestead in San Salvador. An eccentric man and the ruler of El Salvador during one of its greatest economic upswings, he is now mourned by many liberals throughout the country. With a lack of solid candidates to challenge him, it seems that Abelardo Cuadra has become the only candidate and de-facto leader of the Liberal Party."
cendem.35.a: "Abelardo Cuadra will lead the Liberals to victory!"

cendem.36.t: "The Death of Azmitia"
cendem.36.d: "Azmitia González has passed away, victim of a sudden cardiac arrest. His mortal remains are being the object of numerous tributes by the Partido Unionista and the many citizens of our nation who wanted reunification before our nations were finally one once again. He will now be buried in the General Cemetery of Guatemala City under the flag of Unionism, but his death is not the end of the Unionistas. They have called for a new internal election to designate a successor for Azmitia and the two main candidates, Guatemalan Julio Domingo Bianchi Smout and Nicaraguan Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, have already presented their proposals for the future of the party. While Bianchi wants to continue the legacy of Azmitia, Chamorro wants to reform the Unionistas into a more traditional conservative party, and it is time for the party members to decide what shall be the future of the Partido Unionista."
cendem.36.a: "Bianchi wins and successfully succeeds his predecessor."
cendem.36.b: "Chamorro wins the elections and will reform the party."

cendem.37.t: "Partido del Trabajo protests!"
cendem.37.d: "After the restoration of the military as a symbol of pride for Central America, the Partido del Trabajo has protested publicly, calling for people to rally against this display of what they call a 'Stepping stone towards a new autocracy'. While their insults hardly hurt our position, many people who feel afraid that the military might take the same anti-democratic decisions that they had taken in the recent years have been drawn into the Partido del Trabajo in order to fight off this influence."
cendem.37.a: "Our Army needs to improve its Image."

cendem.39.t: "Central America requests our integration"
cendem.39.d: "A delegation of the Central American Nation has arrived today at San Jose with the intention of negotiating the integration of our country into their confederation. While this has sparked mixed reactions amongst our populace, it falls to us to decide what we shall do regarding unification with our former brothers."
cendem.39.a: "Agree to their proposal and start working on unification measures."
cendem.39.b: "Agree to their proposal but demand autonomy within the union."
cendem.39.c: "Refuse their proposal."

cendem.40.t: "Costa Rica Accepts Integration"
cendem.40.d: "The Costa Rican government has agreed to be integrated into our nation once more. As the red, blue and white banner flies for the last time in Costa Rica, the people rejoice at the final member of the original Federation re-joining our nation as equals."
cendem.40.a: "It is a historic day for Central America!"

cendem.41.t: "Costa Rica Asks to Remain Autonomous within the Union"
cendem.41.d: "Our delegation in Costa Rica has informed us that the Costa Ricans are interested in joining the Central American nation. However, they ask to be given a greater autonomy than the one we've given the other members of the confederation to the point that we would hardly have any executive power over them. What should be our response?"
cendem.41.a: "We accept their Terms."
cendem.41.b: "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.42.t: "Costa Rica Refuses to Join!"
cendem.42.d: "The Costa Rican government have turned down our offer and refuse to join our nation. While many hot-headed politicians in the Unionista party are calling for war in order to solve this situation, the other parties find this solution completely abhorrent and ask for Costa Rica to be left alone. However, this may be the last chance we get to unify all the old Federal Republic of Central America members, and we ought to weight our options carefully."
cendem.42.a: "Kindly accept their decision and try to keep friendly relations."
cendem.42.b: "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.43.t: "Central America accepts our request"
cendem.43.d: "Our Central American brothers have accepted the terms of our agreement, and we're now making the move to complete our integration into their nation."
cendem.43.a: "Magnifico!"

 cendem.44.t: "Costa Rica joins Central America"
 cendem.44.d: "The nation of Costa Rica has decided to join the Central American nation and has left our alliance. We have no reason not to let them go in order to keep good relations with the Central American nation."
 cendem.44.a: "Très bien."

cendem.46.t: "Central America requests our integration"
cendem.46.d: "A delegation of the Central American Nation has arrived today at Ciudad de Panama with the intention of negotiating the integration of our country into their confederation. While this has sparked mixed reactions amongst our populace, it falls to us to decide what we shall do regarding unification with our would-be brothers."
cendem.46.a: "Agree to their proposal and start working on unification measures."
cendem.46.b: "Agree to their proposal but demand autonomy within the union."
cendem.46.c: "Refuse their proposal."

cendem.47.t: "Panama accepts to integrate"
cendem.47.d: "The Panamanean government has agreed to be integrated into our nation once more. As the red, blue and white banner flies for the last time in Panama, the people look at our new brothers with enthusiasm as we enter a new tomorrow."
cendem.47.a: "Another diplomatic victory for our nation!"

cendem.48.t: "Panama demands autonomy within the union!"
cendem.48.d: "Our delegation in Panama has informed us that the Panamaneans are interested in joining the Central American nation. However, they ask to be given a greater autonomy than the one we've given the other members of the confederation to the point that we would hardly have any executive power over them. What should be our response?"
cendem.48.a: "We accept their Terms."
cendem.48.b: "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.49.t: "Panama Refuses to Join!"
cendem.49.d: "The Panamanean government have turned down our offer and refuse to join our nation. While many hot-headed politicians in the Unionista party are calling for war in order to solve this situation, the other parties find this solution completely abhorrent and ask for Panama to be left alone. However, this may be the last chance we get to unify all of Central America at long last, and we ought to weight our options carefully."
cendem.49.a: "Kindly accept their decision and try to keep friendly relations."
cendem.49.b: "Recall the Delegation. We will solve this by force!"

cendem.50.t: "Central America Accepts our Request"
cendem.50.d: "Our new Central American brothers have accepted the terms of our agreement, and we're now making the move to complete our integration into their nation."

 cendem.51.d: "The nation of Panama has decided to join the Central American nation and has left our alliance. We have no reason not to let them go in order to keep good relations with the Central American nation."
 cendem.51.a: "Très bien."

cendem.100.t: "Foundation of the Universidad Zamorano"
 cendem.100.d: "Today, the Universidad Zamorano, has been founded in Honduras with the help of American Businessman Samuel Zemurray, one of the most influential UFC share-holders. The magnate, needing more capable manpower for his company, has generously founded the university for us to use as long as we recognise the institution and private. In order to solidify his staff, he has placed the renowned American botanist Wilson Popenoe, now widower of archaeologist Dorothy Popenoe, who will supervise all developments in the University and help students integrate faster to the UFC's working standards."
cendem.100.a: "One more step towards improving our nation."

cendem.101.t: "Foundation of the Universidad Centroamericana"
cendem.101.d: "The Compañía de Jesús has decided to make a contribution to our nation by funding the creation of a new university in Nicaragua. The project, lead by the Jesuit priest León Pallais Godoy, has opened its doors today, and our party has already offered to fund several of their careers in order to make education accessible for more Nicaraguans."
cendem.101.a: "We are grateful."

cendem.102.t: "Construction of the Ciudad Universitaria 'Dr. Fabio Castillo Figueroa'"
cendem.102.d: "The University of El Salvador was in need of an expansion, and since the times where the tyrant Martinez ruled their nation, the university has been more than willing to cooperate with the government. We shall woo them to our side by funding the acquisition of the San Carlos Homestead and beginning the expansion of their facilities. Hopefully this will help sustain the support of the PT in El Salvador, as well as improving the quality of our professional workforce in the future."
cendem.102.a: "San Salvador will become a place of knowledge!"

cendem.103.t: "Autonomisation of the Universidad Nacional de Honduras"
 cendem.103.d: "L'Université Nationale du Honduras est sous le contrôle de l'Église Catholique depuis sa création en 1847, date à laquelle elle a été inaugurée avec le parrainage de l'évêque Francisco de Paula Campoy y Pérez. Notre gouvernement a décidé que la meilleure façon d'avancer était d'appliquer nos prémisses de sécularisation et d'adopter la «Ley Orgánica de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras», qui placera l'institution sous le contrôle direct du gouvernement, et lui attribuera un budget annuel pour permettre à plus étudiants d'accéder à des études supérieures."
cendem.103.a: "Honduras has its education freed from oppression at last."

cendem.104.t: "The Other Parties Protest our intervention!"
cendem.104.d: "Backlash after the war declaration has been immediate. With the war being declared without being informed to the congress, the other parties have all come together in protest against our actions, and are actively calling out for Centroamerican citizens to burn their draft cards and to rally in the streets to protest our actions. Even our own supporters are slowly drifting away from our party after that rash decision, and we have no choice now but to accept the consequences of our actions."
cendem.104.a: "Damnit! It wasn't supposed to be like this!"

cendem.105.t: "Universidad Nacional de Guatemala becomes Autonomous"
cendem.105.d: "The Guatemalan tyrants like Orellana and Ubico have reduced the old Universidad Nacional de Guatemala to a mere state puppet of foreign companies throughout the years, kicking students that didn't agree with their regimes and slowing down several others in order to force them to comply. In order to prevent this from happening in the future, we shall decree total autonomy for the University. From now on, the University will be officially known as the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala and will have their own election system, and a yearly budget that we shall adjust based on their needs and projects."
cendem.105.a: "Another trace of tyranny erased from our nation."

cendem.106.t: "The Book "El Señor Presidente" is published"
cendem.106.d: "The Guatemalan writer Miguel Ángel Asturias has finally published what many consider to be his masterpiece. The author claims to have finished the book in 1933, having to hide his work for years from authoritarian regimes that would've censored it. His book, taking several characteristics of the Magic realism genre, explores the nature of dictatorships and its effects on the society at large. Many are drawing parallels with the book and Asturias' observations of the Cabrebra government in Guatemala, and is quickly becoming a hit both in our country and in the rest of Latin America, with even other renowned writers calling it a 'point of reference' for Latin American literature overall."
cendem.106.a: "A masterful work of literature!"

cendem.107.t: "Expenditure of a New Passport for our Citizens"
cendem.107.d: "As the structure of the Central American nation becomes stronger with each passing day, we have decided to get rid of the old passports of the old individual members of the federation, and we will introduce a Central American Passport, so all who travel around the world be known as Central American, rather than part of an artificial construct like the previous nations were."
cendem.107.a: "Another step to unite our nation."

cendem.108.t: "The Central American Bank is founded!"
cendem.108.d: "After having extensive talks with the several state banking institutions within the different nations, an agreement has been reached by all sides to create the Central American Bank, effectively dissolving all previous state banking institutions and putting their assets, both public and private, under the jurisdiction of the new entity. This move will certainly help reduce bureaucracy and facilitate the funding of projects throughout the nation, as we now only need to contact one bank instead of having to gather funds from several others for a single project. This unification has also left us with a great deal of extra capital available which will come in handy in the future reforms."
cendem.108.a: "Uniting our efforts, we can truly achieve greatness."

cendem.109.t: "Our Farmers are suffering from our autarky efforts"
cendem.109.d: "As we allow foreign companies to enter our country, the rural areas of the country are seeing a massive exodus towards the cities, where many new industries are being placed in dire need of workers. The farms and plantations can't compete with the wages the industrial sector is offering, and this is causing a severe manpower shortage in the agricultural sector, reducing production levels and hurting the rural peasantry."
cendem.109.a: "It's the price of progress."

cendem.110.t: "Expeditions that scouted for Resources end in Failure"
cendem.110.d: "In order to achieve total autarky, we have sent several expeditions to scout for resources throughout our country. However, our expeditions have reported back and there are hardly any new resources to be found, none that can be exploited on an industrial level. We have to unfortunately accept foreign resources as we can't sustain ourselves with our local ones."
cendem.110.a: "We will have to focus on industry then..."

cendem.111.t: "Industry Report of our last reforms"
cendem.111.d: "As our industrial investment have started to report profits, the reports are underwhelming compared to our projections when we started project. It seems that, despite how much we invest in industry and infrastructure, we cannot fully achieve autarky since it's both hurting our rural peasantry and the industry is dependant on the imports of foreign raw materials in order to work. However, the industrial investment has yielded a significant amount of wealth for our cities' population, and while autarky is now proving more and more to be impossible, we are still being benefited by our investments."
cendem.111.a: "Well, we'll have to balance our system from now on."

cendem.112.t: "Equal laws for an equal people"
 cendem.112.d: "As we push for new legislation throughout our nation, we are noticing more and more regional laws that undermine the livelihood of the black and native populations in our nation. As we enter a new age for our subcontinent, we are endeavouring our efforts towards cleaning up the remains of these despotic legislations and truly embracing the ideals of civic nationalism, allowing these minorities to truly take part in our nation's decision making and every day affairs. In order to do so, President [Root.GetLeader] has decreed that all old prejudices from old legislations be abolished, and a new set of Federal laws be complied in the individual regions. Considering the Decentralised approach of the PNR, this has come to surprise the PT, but it's a move that is both supported by the PL and PUD, allowing the legislation to be passed without further issues."
cendem.112.a: "Diversity is not a weakness, it's a strength!"

cendem.113.t: "New set of laws are passed to Sideline the Military"
cendem.113.d: "With the decades of authoritarianism that Central America has endured, President [Root.GetLeader] has decided to enact a series of law reforms to restrain and contain military power to strictly national defence, and has proposed several safeguards to be added to the constitution in order to prevent a military takeover to happen ever again."
cendem.113.a: "We seek to avoid the errors of the past."

cendem.114.t: "Corruption Trials start"
 cendem.114.d: "After a great deal of debate with the PL, the corruption trials have finally been authorised by the congress. An in depth national investigation has started and several names of several important companies, including the United Fruit Company have come out. These individuals will be processed for their crimes and enacted an embargo of their ill-acquired goods and apply a jail sentence in the most extreme cases. Hopefully, this process will finish soon enough, and without major repercussions"
cendem.114.a: "Money can't save you from the swift hammer of Justice!"

cendem.115.t: "Nationalisation laws create controversy"
 cendem.115.d: "After our nationalisation laws managed to be passed with a very slim majority, several representatives of the Partido Unionista and the Partido Liberal have come together to express their discontent at this turn of events, even accusing us of trying to collectivise the economy. While these insults are nothing but buzzwords, we are aware that there's public unrest regarding this law, and we should try to restrict its use to only key economic sectors."
cendem.115.a: "We need to thread carefully."

cendem.116.t: "Corruption Trials End"
cendem.116.d: "After several hundred employees and concerned citizens have testified, and solid evidence has been presented, around 500 individuals, among high ranking politicians and industrial and rural barons, have been identified of embezzlement and illicit enrichment, and have been sentenced to a 4 million dollar embargo and varying prison times depending on the severity of their crimes. While there probably is still plenty of local corruption, the overall goal for the party has been achieved. While the search for corruption will continue, it'll be at a slower pace, and delegated to the individual states."
cendem.116.a: "The future has become a bit brighter."

cendem.199.t: "Friendship with the Central American nations"
cendem.199.d: "As we now look to expand our influence abroad, the chamber of deputies has come forth with a series of diplomatic proposals to improve relations with our neighbouring nations. While we certainly do not know what the result of this action will entail, we do know that we are trying to reassure our diplomatic position in the continent as well as securing the future peace of our nation."
cendem.199.a: "Let's contact the embassies and send the proposals."

cendem.200.t: "Central America wants to sign a Friendship Treaty"
cendem.200.d: "The Central American Nation has contacted our embassy today to have us review a friendship treaty their chamber of deputies has approved. The proposal itself details a diplomatic reassurance were both countries promise to stand up for each other in case of an invasion, and reduces tariffs to trade between our country and theirs, and even stating that they're willing to create a free trade area further down the line if the treaty is accepted.

cendem.225.d: "After the all votes were counted, the Socialist PNR has been found victorious in the election. This has immediately sparked protests from the Unionista party, claiming the elections were rigged, and that the socialists were going to lead the republic towards disaster. While their protests do hurt us publicly, we still hold a tenuous control over the deputy chamber with the help of the PT, but we will have to thread carefully in order to avoid getting the Unionista and the Liberal parties united against us, as this would lead to our laws to be blocked both in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies."

Marching to the sound of songs like Amor Patrio or the Marcha de Gerardo Barrios, we stand truly united as one nation, even if we value our differences."

CEN_DEM_get_costa_rica_desc: "Costa Rica used to be part of the original Central American Federation back in the 19th century, and with their strong democratic traditions, it is only right that we request them to join us, considering they shall have the proper representation in our system they should have no reason to refuse."
CEN_DEM_get_panama: "Welcome Panama as the 6th Republic"
CEN_DEM_get_panama_desc: "Panama is another member of the subcontinent that now stands isolated due to the American Civil War.

CEN_DEM_more_centralisation: "Consolidate the Republic"
 CEN_DEM_more_centralisation_desc: "The Republican system in our country must be expanded upon over the regional systems that the old Central American nations used to have. As it stands right now, our republican institutions serve more on an advisory role to the local governorships. We shall focus on expanding its power, which shall centralise our government even further and allow us to cut out unnecessary red tape."
CEN_DEM_power_judges: "The Supreme Court of Central America"
CEN_DEM_power_judges_desc: "The Judiciary branch now works independently in the individual regions instead of having a higher governing body overseeing them. We shall create the Supreme Court of Central America to fill this need and to handle cases that regard national affairs rather than provincial ones."
CEN_DEM_power_law: "Impose Federal Laws on the Republics"
CEN_DEM_power_law_desc: "We currently have a set of Federal Guidelines for the law codes in our nations, which are partially implemented in our provinces. We are not satisfied by the current system, and we believe that enforcing the Federal law to the letter while integrating local legislation to the regional code laws will be a wiser move in the long run and will help us consolidate the Federal Government as the true governing body."

 CEN_DEM_integrate_infrastructure: "Unifier le Réseau Route et Rail"
 CEN_DEM_integrate_infrastructure_desc: "Les réseaux de transport en commun en Amérique Centrale sont rares et très espacés. Les rares dont nous disposons n'utilisent même pas le même écartement ferroviaire! Nous devrons donc créer une nouvelle administration des chemins de fer, et entreprendre des réformes pour nous adapter à un nouvel écartement ferroviaire standard, et développer les routes et chemins de fer dans tout le pays."
CEN_DEM_support_diverse_industry: "Incentivise National Corporations"
CEN_DEM_support_diverse_industry_desc: "With the rebirth of our nation as a regional power, we need to also strengthen our economical position. A set of tariffs and tax cuts to our local industries will make sure our industry grows and our local industrialist value our regime more."
CEN_DEM_central_american_oath: "Oath of Allegiance to the Republic"
CEN_DEM_central_american_oath_desc: "With the end of the individual nations that once composed Central America, we need to enact a new Oath of allegiance. The people of our nation will no longer swear an oath to their individual flags, but to our nation as a whole to defend their brothers from any foreign foe."
CEN_DEM_usurp_power: "Usurp Provincial Autonomy"
 CEN_DEM_usurp_power_desc: "The Provinces within our nation have enjoyed a relative decentralised executive structure, which allowed them to run their internal affairs but absolutely gridlocked any attempts to cooperation. We shall reduce their overall autonomy in order to increase our cooperation capabilities nation-wide."

CEN_DEM_foreign_relations: "Defending Our Interests"
CEN_DEM_foreign_relations_desc: "With our internal reforms nearing their end, we can start looking outwards into the larger world. With the rise of radicalism worldwide, we need to take a stand in world affairs and take up arms for the sake of liberty and democracy!"

CEN_DEM_do_it_harder_desc: "Love them or hate them, there's no denying that the big corporations like Krupp or the United Fruit Company make the world turn with their money and influence. We need to get on their side and tap into their profits if we ever hope to reach economic independence."
CEN_DEM_reverse_brain_drain: "Attract Foreign Engineers"
CEN_DEM_reverse_brain_drain_desc: "One of the major grievances that all the Central American nations suffered was the lack of a qualified workforce, and despite decades of educational efforts, most of those experts that came out of our institutions just packed their bags and sailed for more prosperous countries. We need to bring them back, and so we will offer tempting wages for foreign experts to lend their services to our country."
CEN_DEM_just_kill_my_workers_already: "Generous Tax Cuts For Industry"
CEN_DEM_just_kill_my_workers_already_desc: "In order to attract more foreign investment and incentivise small businesses to grow, we shall enact a series of generous industrial tax cuts so more industries may establish themselves in our territories."
CEN_DEM_i_hate_cash_crops: "Harshly Tax Cash Crops"
CEN_DEM_i_hate_cash_crops_desc: "Cash Crops are the bane of Central America, forcing our populaces to become addicted to these cheap-to-produce goods. In order to disincentivise their usage, we shall harshly tax their usage and, with the surplus generated by the new income, we shall invest our gains into the consumer goods market."
CEN_DEM_need_the_bank: "The Central American Bank"
 CEN_DEM_need_the_bank_desc: "Until now, we have kept a coalition of the banks that were left over by the unification process. This coalition that has held each province's state funds is now nearing its end.

CEN_DEM_loan_extravaganza: "Cheap Loans for Local Industry"
CEN_DEM_loan_extravaganza_desc: "The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in Central America. However, big companies in our nation are making their growth difficult. We shall start a program of cheap industrial loans, where we will charge very low interest rates to local producers to establish their own businesses with a flexible financial payment system. Hopefully this will give us the edge in local industry to hopefully one day stop depending on foreign ones."
CEN_DEM_soclib_costa_rica: "Treaty of Friendship with Costa Rica"
CEN_DEM_soclib_costa_rica_desc: "We wish the Costa Ricans no harm, but their recent actions have left us troubled to the possibility of a southward attack. While we would despise having to go to war so soon after reunifying, we cannot allow them to just backstab us right when we're about to reach our goals. We shall draft a friendship proposal and see if maybe there's still a path for a peaceful resolution..."
CEN_DEM_soclib_kill_costa_rica: "Eliminate the Hostiles to the South"
CEN_DEM_soclib_kill_costa_rica_desc: "The Costa Rican rejection is outraging the public, and fears of an attack are around after such a humiliating display of diplomacy.

CEN_DEM_we_fed_up: "Moderation is Key"
 CEN_DEM_we_fed_up_desc: "Now that we are finally realising the damages that autarky is causing, we cannot deny the benefits industrialisation has brought to our country.

CEN_DEM_back_to_bananas: "Rescind the harsh Cash Crop Policies"
CEN_DEM_back_to_bananas_desc: "The Cash Crop tax policies have bled many of our farmers dry, and forcing many of our peasants into poverty. We regret that this was the way things turned out, but we're still in time to fix it, and so we will rescind the previous tax policies."
CEN_DEM_more_friends: "Realise the Failures of Our Policies"
CEN_DEM_more_friends_desc: "Despite all our efforts, we haven't achieved the main goals of the Four Year plan, and our projections show that even if we were to continue down this path, we will never be able to achieve it anyhow. It's time to take responsibility and start reforming to adapt to our real situation..."
CEN_DEM_live_up_to_the_name: "Expand Workers Rights"
CEN_DEM_live_up_to_the_name_desc: "Workers have become one of the most disenfranchised groups with the four year plan, allowing foreign industries to exploit them for their every whim. Now that we don't need their investments so much, we can provide our workers with job security and better safety regulations in order to favour them over the industrialists."
CEN_DEM_back_to_taxing: "Increase Taxes on Industry"
CEN_DEM_back_to_taxing_desc: "Industry has become a great part of the Central American economy, but since most of it is built upon Tax breaks and government loans, we aren't receiving as much income as we once hoped. We shall enact stricter taxes with our industrial sector, which will hopefully grant us a surplus to invest elsewhere."

CEN_DEM_Mar_Lib_desc: "The Partido de Unificación Democrática has won the elections! With their vision of a neutral Central America, their reforms will focus on improving the nation's diplomatic standing on the world stage, secure various trade partners and reinvest the trade profits into the local infrastructure."
CEN_DEM_trade_buddies: "Diversify Trade Partners"
CEN_DEM_trade_buddies_desc: "One of the major mistakes that the previous Central American nations made was to trust their economies to a single trade partner, that being the United States. With their collapse into Civil War, our economies suffered harshly as a result, and we should avoid having such strict relations with any specific country ever again. As such, we'll begin contacting countries worldwide and let them know we are open for business."
CEN_DEM_marlib_sideline_military: "Completely Defang the Military"
CEN_DEM_marlib_sideline_military_desc: "The Military has been the greatest danger of Central American Democracy since the start of the century and we are not willing to gamble away our liberty for the sake of security.

CEN_DEM_were_not_centralist: "Unity in Diversity"
 CEN_DEM_were_not_centralist_desc: "Central America is a nation of contrasts.

CEN_DEM_more_federation_desc: "The Constitutional Convention established a series of principles for our young Federation. However, these new ideas don't hold any real legal weight as of yet. We will focus on changing that, making sure that no faction in Central America may decide that the Federation no longer suits their needs..."
CEN_DEM_peace_please: "Peace in Our Time"
CEN_DEM_peace_please_desc: "Central America has seen too much fighting in the last few years. People who were once peaceful neighbours turned into bitter enemies seemingly overnight. Our people has had enough, and we will uphold the peace that we have so hardly fought to achieve for the rest of our government. If such is the will of the people, then we shall oblige to them..."
CEN_DEM_were_wusses: "Friendship in Central America"
CEN_DEM_were_wusses_desc: "The nations in Central America must feel threatened at the developments in our region of the subcontinent. In just a few short years, our countries clashed into violent struggle, and they are wise to be wary of us in case we'd want to drag them into our chaos. However, things have settled down now, and it's time to start building bridges between us for the sake of peace."
CEN_DEM_more_freedom: "Entrench Our Freedoms"
CEN_DEM_more_freedom_desc: "Many within our nation have had the harsh luck of having to live under an authoritarian regime at least once during the last decade. These men and women wouldn't want their liberty taken away again, and as such we will start passing laws to protect the freedom of expression, of press and of assembly from anyone who may want to infringe upon it, both publicly or privately."
CEN_DEM_ancapistan: "Pass Business-Friendly Laws"
CEN_DEM_ancapistan_desc: "The way forward for Central America is to become a shining beacon of prosperity for the world to see.

CEN_DEM_a_promising_future: "A Promising Future"
CEN_DEM_a_promising_future_desc: "Slowly but steadily, things are starting to look up for our nation after the chaos that was the subcontinent not so long ago.

CEN_DEM_become_switserland: "Try to Attain Neutrality"
 CEN_DEM_become_switserland_desc: "Only way to secure peace in the long run is to get the world powers to recognise we are a neutral nation, and that offer to support us in case of a conflict breaking out against us. We shall send proposals to the closest regional powers that may be interested in supporting our neutrality."

CEN_DEM_university_expansion: "Fund Universities Across Central America"
CEN_DEM_university_expansion_desc: "Central America currently has a shortage of institutions of higher learning to improve the quality of our workforce. We shall start a funding frenzy to create new universities and start reforming the existing ones in order to grant them a much needed operational autonomy."
CEN_DEM_selfmade_entrepreneurs: "Encourage the Self-Employed"
 CEN_DEM_selfmade_entrepreneurs_desc: "Small businesses in Central America are few and far in between. We cannot neglect the self-employed since they are the backbone of any modern economy, and we will strive to subsidise their activities in order to promote their establishment and growth."
CEN_DEM_tax_the_rich: "Progressive Taxation"
CEN_DEM_tax_the_rich_desc: "We can't tax the unemployed the same way we tax the wealthy. We need to create a tax system that truly adapts to the reality of the citizens in our nation, so that they may contribute to the state in the amount that they can. It is for this that we shall enact a progressive taxation system, so that no poor becomes too poor thanks to the government, nor any oligarch too rich due to negligence."
CEN_DEM_standard_oil_is_bad: "Strong Anti-Trust Laws"
CEN_DEM_standard_oil_is_bad_desc: "Corporate monopolies have not only hurt Central American democracy in the past, but they have also hurt the newly born small businesses in our region for decades. We shall install strong anti trust laws to avoid corporate monopolies to flourish in our nation and hinder the progress of our entrepreneurs."
CEN_DEM_federalism_is_socialism: "Expand the Rights of the Republics"
CEN_DEM_federalism_is_socialism_desc: "Through pen or sword, all the republics that conformed Central America have been united. This doesn't mean there should be any resentment between us, nor that they should loathe an oppressive Central Government imposing itself over them. We shall establish a set of laws to protect the autonomy of the internal regions, much to the disgust of the Unionistas."
CEN_DEM_army_is_nerfed: "Reform Army Command Structure"
CEN_DEM_army_is_nerfed_desc: "The Army has for too long held too much executive power, leading to coups, conspiracies and oppression. We shall not give them the chance to escape from the government's leash again and so we shall enforce harsh restrictions on the Armed forces' autonomy."
 CEN_DEM_decentralised_economy: "A Decentralised Economy"
 CEN_DEM_decentralised_economy_desc: "We shouldn't try to centralise the economy under the Central Government, and we should instead let the individual regions handle their regional autonomies however they see fit. This way we can secure a flexible and free economy while favouring the local governments."
CEN_DEM_general_rotation: "Military Staff Rotation"
CEN_DEM_general_rotation_desc: "Long serving officers in the army have proved to be treacherous in the past, and it is with this in mind that we shall enact yearly staff rotations. On one hand it'll reduce the chance of any officer from becoming too influential and will allow low ranking officers to take charge of better posts more often, thus gaining more experience."
CEN_DEM_expanding_middle_class: "An Expanding Middle Class"
CEN_DEM_expanding_middle_class_desc: "With the growth of entrepreneurs in our country, we have finally achieved our objective of establishing a small, but functional middle class. We should not stop here, and we should encourage everyone in the working class to work hard to achieve the success of their fellow countrymen and that way expand our middle class further."
CEN_DEM_inequality_no_more: "Sickening Inequality No More"
CEN_DEM_inequality_no_more_desc: "In the past, Central America was known as a sub-continent with huge contrasts between the lifestyles of the rich and the poor. Now however, we have finally been able to bridge the gap between them, and create a society that's both more fair and more inclusive than the one we inherited. Our reforms can be considered a success and the profits from our success are starting to come in."
CEN_DEM_stealthy_acquisition: "Pounce at the Right Opportunity"

CEN_DEM_local_judges: "Local Law Jurisdiction Reigns Supreme"
CEN_DEM_local_judges_desc: "The Federal Government has its own responsibilities and each republic has their own as well. It's because of this that we don't support the supremacy of federal laws over the local legislations.

CEN_DEM_no_more_evasion: "Clamp Down on Tax Evasion"
CEN_DEM_no_more_evasion_desc: "Surprisingly, tax evasion in Central America is one of the greatest losses of capital that our government has, and now that we have begun to create a welfare state, that capital would come really handy to improve our budget. We shall create a tax agency and begin clamping down on tax evasion, reducing taxes for those who cooperate and punishing harshly those who try to cheat their way out of the system."
CEN_DEM_bourgeousie_begone: "Have Corruption Stand Trial"
CEN_DEM_bourgeousie_begone_desc: "Corruption has been the bane of Central American nations, with huge companies like the United Fruit Company pulling the strings of entire nations from the shadows. We shall not allow our country to be manipulated so easily, and we shall start hunting those who dare sell their countrymen for money."
CEN_DEM_minimum_wage: "A Guaranteed Minimum Wage"
CEN_DEM_minimum_wage_desc: "Central America lacked for decades a minimum wage, allowing companies to exploit the peasants and workers of the nation. We shall enact a minimum wage to protect our working class and make sure the local governments respect it as a guideline for their regions."
CEN_DEM_military_is_not_politics: "Ensure Separation of State Organs"
 CEN_DEM_military_is_not_politics_desc: "La Constitution que nous avons rédigée stipule que la République centraméricaine aura un pouvoir législatif, un pouvoir exécutif et un pouvoir judiciaire, avec des entités distinctes qui doivent travailler indépendamment. En l'état actuel des choses, ils fonctionnent comme prévu, mais rien n'empêche cette relative harmonie de s'effondrer à l'avenir. Nous commencerons à promulguer des lois pour augmenter l'autonomie de chaque branche par rapport à l'autre, afin d'empêcher la domination de l'une d'entre elles."

CEN_DEM_money_for_old_people_desc: "Following the ideals of Salvadorian intellectual Masferrer, we shall try to grant every person in the country a chance for a better life, and in order to do so it would be best to start ensuring that people may be able to afford their pensions.

CEN_DEM_lol_i_won_desc: "The other parties object to our victory, but we have won in the ballots fair and square, and we shall do all the necessary checks to prove that we won legitimately. They may disagree with our ideology, but they can not disagree with the system we have all agreed upon not so long ago!"
 CEN_DEM_forget_about_it: "Reject the Ideal of Centroamérica"
CEN_DEM_forget_about_it_desc: "One of the main fears our opposition has is that we will just seek to do away with our hardly fought democracy and create a new dictatorship of the proletariat. We need to distance ourselves in the public eye from the socialists radicals and show them that we are truly committed to democracy and compromise with whoever wants to work with us."
CEN_DEM_were_all_equal: "Promote Equality Between Races"
CEN_DEM_were_all_equal_desc: "The more things have changed in Central America, the more they have remained the same. Natives continue to be oppressed under the creole boot, and the African descendants continue to be ignored in our society. Now that we're in power, we shall not only encourage equality, we shall enforce it. A series of laws stating the equality of all of the Central American citizens and the severity of a racial offence might do the job..."
CEN_DEM_more_schools: "Schooling for Every Central American"

 CEN_DEM_no_big_guys_radsoc_edition_desc: "Central America has gone through enough war already.

CEN_DEM_oh_no_the_socialists_desc: "In order to continue our reforms, we need to create the legal framework to allow for nationalisation of key industries. This move is bound to cause a harsh reaction by our opponents, but the sooner we have this done, the better."
CEN_DEM_telephone_for_everyone: "Nationalise the Telephony Industry"
 CEN_DEM_telephone_for_everyone_desc: "The Telephonic industry in our nation is a vital asset, and we consider that we cannot allow it to be controlled by private entities as they can cut off large chunks of our population for the sake of profit.

CEN_DEM_lost_brothers_radsoc_edition: "Trading Partners in the Gulf"
CEN_DEM_lost_brothers_radsoc_edition_desc: "With our neighbours being suspicious of us, maybe our best bet to establish better foreign economic ties would be the Caribbean nations.

CEN_DEM_i_love_mexico: "Raise the Tax Ceiling"
CEN_DEM_i_love_mexico_desc: "Many wealthy industrialists and land owners have managed to amass huge amounts of wealth at their worker's expense.

In order to do so, we shall enact a tax reform that will allow the tax ceiling to be raised."
CEN_DEM_i_love_csa: "Agricultural Subsidies"
 CEN_DEM_i_love_csa_desc: "Agriculture is the lifeblood of Central America, regardless of what the Liberals think. Of course, we wouldn't want our farmers to be afraid of the common market's ups and downs, so we shall start subsidising their activities in order to provide a sense of security and encourage the expansion of our agricultural sector."
CEN_DEM_southern_republics: "Invest in State Companies"
CEN_DEM_southern_republics_desc: "We cannot hope to depend on the free market to do all the work for us. We need an industrial base of our own if we wish to flourish, and so we shall start investing in the formation of key state industries in order to improve our industrial output."
CEN_DEM_islands: "Negligible Unemployment"
CEN_DEM_islands_desc: "Before our rule, hundreds if not thousands of people would be sitting in the city centres throughout the nation, looking for non-existent jobs to feed themselves. While there are probably still a few unemployed men around our country, job opportunities have increased a lot thanks to our nationalisation efforts and job security, and so our reforms can be considered successful by the populace at large."

CEN_DEM_Forging_Uniformity_desc: "Our forces right now are a mixed bag of units with varying levels of training and equipment standards.

CEN_DEM_Complete_Integration_desc: "With our army following a standard, we now just need to integrate the local officer corps into a unified meritocratic system, trying to adapt the officers to a new hierarchy in order to correctly give them their ranks based on their experience and knowledge, rather than any other random standard that the previous republics had."

CEN_DEM_Longterm_Planning_desc: "With our army ready for combat, it would be a wise move to start preparing several defence and offence plans in case of an attack by a foreign power to our nation, not much unlike the United States prepares their Rainbow Plans. We shall contact our national joint planning board to start the preparations."
CEN_DEM_Learn_To_Dig: "Entrenchment Training"
CEN_DEM_Learn_To_Dig_desc: "The harsh terrain in Central America make the art of trench digging a lot more difficult than it is in European battlefields. We shall start a training program to prepare our soldiers to improve their trench digging skills, producing better and safer fortifications that can resist the constant rain and humidity that are so common with the Central American weather."
CEN_DEM_extensive_games: "Extensive War Games"
CEN_DEM_extensive_games_desc: "Only practice can prepare us if a conflict is ever to threaten Central American Democracy once more, and it's because of this that we shall begin an ambitious set of war games to prepare our troops to fight in all manner of environments. From the jungles near Belize to the Volcanoes and hills in El Salvador, our troops will be ready to fight tooth and nail for every inch of ground!"
CEN_DEM_long_conscription: "Instate Long Conscription Times"
CEN_DEM_long_conscription_desc: "Our soldiers are precious, and their experience is now more important than ever before. We can't allow that expertise to be wasted on the civilian front if it's not needed, and so we shall increase conscription times. This way we can keep more of our experienced soldiers for a longer amount of time before they are finally replaced by fresh reserves."
CEN_DEM_United_Force: "The Central American Task Force"
CEN_DEM_United_Force_desc: "The Constitutional Convention has decided that the way forward for the Central American Army is a mixed forces with local militias and an elite federal army and our officers will start making the necessary reforms."
CEN_DEM_Power_To_Local_officers: "Autonomy Down the Command Chain"
CEN_DEM_Power_To_Local_officers_desc: "In order to be able to successfully reform our army into a mixed entity with both a federal and local structure, we cannot use any sort of fixed standards for our officers, so we shall proceed in the opposite direction. We shall grant them some much needed autonomy to carry on their duties with their troops however they see fit, making them responsible for the state of their soldiers and their fighting capabilities."
CEN_DEM_Support_Groups: "Support Teams Integration"
CEN_DEM_Support_Groups_desc: "An elite force isn't just a bunch of veteran soldiers carrying out orders. There have to be engineers assisting their advance on harsh terrains and scouts helping them avoid enemy strongholds and attack enemy weak points. It is the need for such support companies that we shall invest in the integration of said teams to our elite forces."
CEN_DEM_Artillery_Corps: "Incorporate Shelling into the Doctrine"
CEN_DEM_Artillery_Corps_desc: "With our system, we cannot depend on a number advantage to beat the enemy. Luckily, one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century for warfare has been artillery, which allows us to pound enemy positions from relative safety as long as we can outrange the enemy's artillery. In order to always have the upper hand against their artillery, we shall begin investing in better artillery models."
CEN_DEM_Unified_Special_Forces: "The Best of the Best"
 CEN_DEM_Unified_Special_Forces_desc: "The Central American Federal Task Force, or Fuerzas Especiales de CentroAmérica (FECA) shall be moulded to the image of the American Marine Corps or the German Sturmtruppen and will be made of the best soldiers our country can offer."
CEN_DEM_tanks: "Acquire Tank Designs"
CEN_DEM_tanks_desc: "No modern army can underestimate the importance of armoured vehicles in combat, proven by the breakthroughs said machines managed to do achieve during the Weltkrieg. We shall start our own armoured vehicle program, and invite foreign experts to supervise our new designs so that they may be both cheap and effective."
CEN_DEM_motorised: "Begin Motorisation"
CEN_DEM_motorised_desc: "With the improvement in speed in cars during the last few decades, the military relevance of motorised and mechanised cannot be underestimated. We shall start investing in motorised transport models for our troops, which will hopefully help our army become not only the strongest but also the fastest one in the continent."
CEN_DEM_speed: "Swiftness is key"
CEN_DEM_speed_desc: "Armies that can't secure a victory quickly inevitably get drawn into prolonged attrition wars which are both costly and ineffective. We cannot afford ourselves to be drawn into such a conflict with our new armed forces, and it is for this reason that we should focus on achieving a swift victory over our enemies rather than pushing ourselves into an attrition war."
CEN_DEM_combined_arms: "Combined Arms Training"
CEN_DEM_combined_arms_desc: "The theory of combined arms combat is growing more relevant as the use of radio allows for greater coordination between the army, the armoured corps and the air force to combat the enemy more effectively. We shall focus in developing our tactics to incorporate these new doctrines to our fighting style."
CEN_DEM_True_Confed: "Keep the Republican Armies Separated"
 CEN_DEM_True_Confed_desc: "The Constitutional Convention has decided that the way forward for the Central American Army is a decentralised army and our officers will start making the necessary reforms."
CEN_DEM_Divided_But_Equal: "Divided but Equal"
CEN_DEM_Divided_But_Equal_desc: "Our armies may stay separated in terms of structure, but they will be treated as equals before the law, and no region should consider their brother's forces inferior to their own."
CEN_DEM_Watch_The_Watchmen: "Watchers of the Army"
CEN_DEM_Watch_The_Watchmen_desc: "The Federal Government will keep a small token force that will ensure that no local army may disturb the peace of our nation for egoist provincial gains. This peacekeeping force will handle mostly inter-army relations and will work more like a military police than an actual secret police."
CEN_DEM_conscription_propaganda: "Voluntary but Encouraged Conscription"
CEN_DEM_conscription_propaganda_desc: "Volunteers for the army before were few and far in between, mainly because the armies had a bad reputation of harbouring tyrants in waiting and having poor living conditions for the average soldier. We shall do away with such ideas and begin promoting army service like an honourable activity, as well as increasing the army wages significantly to attract less idealistic recruits..."
CEN_DEM_decentralised_plans: "Inter-Republican War Plan Simulations"
CEN_DEM_decentralised_plans_desc: "Only through practice we can manage to keep the edge of the several internal armies in case of a foreign invasion. In order to practice their respective skills, we shall set up a series of war games for our armies to practice manoeuvres and fire practices in a contained environment so that they may be ready in case of conflict."
CEN_DEM_social_works: "Army Infrastructure Projects"
CEN_DEM_social_works_desc: "The army may be property of the provinces, but logistics is on the Central Government's responsibilities. We shall begin a series of infrastructure projects to improve the transportation of supplies across the country so that no division may face a shortage, wherever it may be."
CEN_DEM_no_nepotism: "Discourage Nepotism"
CEN_DEM_no_nepotism_desc: "Nepotism has been practically endemic in most of Central America, and while we do understand that 'better the devil you know than the devil you don't' has its usages in the military sphere, we can't afford the creation of military dynasties in our army that are not based on merit. We shall enact strict meritocratic measures to restrict generals from promoting family members unless they offer the qualifications needed for their posts."
CEN_DEM_military_parades: "Military Parades"
CEN_DEM_military_parades_desc: "A way of instilling pride for our armed forces is the celebration of yearly military parades nationwide, to give a chance to each local army to show off both at home and in the rest of the country the achievements they have accomplished in terms of discipline in such a short time. We shall decree the celebration of a military parade, effective immediately and that shall be made an annual celebration."
CEN_DEM_learn_to_democracy: "Ingrain Democracy in Them"
CEN_DEM_learn_to_democracy_desc: "Democracy must be taught to every soldier and officer, democracy must be shown to be the system that keeps our nation together, and it will be for Democracy that our soldiers shall be willing to fight and die in the frontlines!"
CEN_DEM_loyalty: "A Most Loyal Army to the Confederation"
CEN_DEM_loyalty_desc: "Our armies, beyond their individual loyalties to their respective nation, also have a responsibility to a national scale to protect their brothers and sisters from the other members of the Confederacy as well as they would defend their own people. It is this feeling of camaraderie that gives our federal government the loyalty of its troops above the individual provinces, as each soldier knows that there's more at stake that just their provinces."

## Air Tree
CEN_DEM_Skies_Unknown: "Airplane Trials"
CEN_DEM_Skies_Unknown_desc: "The Central American Federation has begun its plans to build a new Air Force to defend ourselves. In order to begin this difficult task, early trials of new airplanes have begun to test the ability of our country to develop and fly these powerful engines."
CEN_DEM_Back_to_base_ics: "Airfield Constructions"
CEN_DEM_Back_to_base_ics_desc: "In order for our planes to fly, they must be able to land and take off safely. For this reason, the Central American Federation has begun the construction of new airfields for the use of our new Air Force. This will allow us to use more planes at once and successfully defend our airspace against attackers."
CEN_DEM_Shatter_their_Skies: "Flak Gun Advancements"
CEN_DEM_Shatter_their_Skies_desc: "Our ships need new weapons in order to keep them competitive. We must advance our flak gun technology and mount it on our ships in order to improve their fighting power and effectiveness in battle. These guns will help our fleet immensely."
CEN_DEM_Three_kinds_of_Aces: "Ace Pilot Initiative"
 CEN_DEM_Three_kinds_of_Aces_desc: "The morale and efficiency of our Air Force will grow exponentially if our pilots have heroes to look up to and emulate. We must find pilots willing to do everything for their country, pilots who exceed what everyone thinks is possible. Hopefully, this will help us find new ace pilots in order to be the faces of our new Air Force."
CEN_DEM_Seek_Strength: "Fighters Arms Race"
CEN_DEM_Seek_Strength_desc: "We must not sit by idly as other countries develop better and more advances fighters that will easily outperform ours. We must stay competitive and work hard to develop and field newer and better fighter models. Our best minds must be put to work to make this happen."
CEN_DEM_Live_For_Pride: "Dogfight Training"
CEN_DEM_Live_For_Pride_desc: "Our pilots need to be trained in what could be called the art of dogfighting. They must be trained intensively in all kinds of situations in order to be able to always outmanoeuvre the enemy. If we learn them to become true heroes of dogfighting, our Air Force will become formidable through the sheer quality of our pilots alone."
CEN_DEM_Read_The_Tide_of_Battle: "Long Range Detection"
CEN_DEM_Read_The_Tide_of_Battle_desc: "RADARs are starting to become more and more common with new developments like the Decimetric radar allowing for a more accurate tracking of aerial objects in a determined airspace. It is clear to us that such a technology will become vital to secure our airspace from anyone who may dare cross into Central American skies, and it is because of this that we shall start investing in these innovative technology."
CEN_DEM_Multirole_Bombers: "Multirole Bombers"
 CEN_DEM_Multirole_Bombers_desc: "Our quickly modernising Air Force has found the need for a new type of plane. We need bombers fit not for just one specific task, but with more flexible application in order to serve our diverse needs. For this reason, we must focus on developing multirole bombers, which will surely help us in the case of a war."
CEN_DEM_Fighter_Bombers: "Fighter-Bombers"
CEN_DEM_Fighter_Bombers_desc: "Our current bomber fleet cannot properly protect itself, and our fighter fleet cannot properly damage the enemy. We must introduce a new type of plane to our Air Force, the fighter-bomber. These planes will have both fighting and bombing capability and will allow us to win the skies and rain down fire on those who wish to threaten our democracy."
CEN_DEM_Sea_Bomber_Trials: "Sea-Bomber Trials"
 CEN_DEM_Sea_Bomber_Trials_desc: "Our current Air Force lacks the power to damage enemy ships. We need to develop specialised sea-bombers that will be able to bomb enemy ships much more effectively. This specialisation will allow us to prevent enemy ships from arriving on our shores, possibly threatening our democracy."

## Naval Tree
CEN_DEM_Propose_Naval_Ventures: "Propose Naval Ventures"
CEN_DEM_Propose_Naval_Ventures_desc: "Our current navy is weak. Therefore, we must take a look at the possibility of focusing our military efforts on expanding it. If we don't, we will be the plaything of the other great powers. With a fleet, we can successfully defend our shores from those who would seek to topple our liberal democracy."
CEN_DEM_Merhcant_Fleets: "The Merchant Fleet"
CEN_DEM_Merhcant_Fleets_desc: "Our country lacks a formal merchant navy to speak off, and if we even want to consider starting a formal military navy, then maybe we should worry about acquiring a civilian navy first. We shall buy a few transport ships in the world market and then invest in some small dockyards to maintain these small merchant fleet."
CEN_DEM_Training_Next_Gen: "Next Generation of Naval Officers"
 CEN_DEM_Training_Next_Gen_desc: "Our expanding navy requires officers that can properly handle the crews and efficiently control our ships. Without a proper officer corps, our ships will be little more than big pieces of floating metal. We must train a new generation of officers in order to properly staff our new ships and maintain the efficiency of our navy."
CEN_DEM_New_Drydocks: "New Drydocks"
CEN_DEM_New_Drydocks_desc: "In order to execute our naval expansion plans, we need new drydocks to aid us in the construction of new ships. These drydocks are expensive and we must focus our efforts in order to create a proper location for shipbuilding industries."
CEN_DEM_Convoy_Defense_Fleet: "Convoy Defence Fleet"
CEN_DEM_Convoy_Defense_Fleet_desc: "The most important thing on the seas is the protection of our trade. We need to defend our trade convoys and in order to do that we must seek the ships that will perform that task adequately. We cannot afford to spend too much resources on other things."
CEN_DEM_Sea_Lane_Defense: "Sea Lane Patrols"
CEN_DEM_Sea_Lane_Defense_desc: "With our newly acquired merchant fleet, we now run the risk of losing these precious cargo vessels to stealthy submarines and rogue destroyers. We cannot allow them to endanger our merchant fleet, and in order to protect said ships, we shall fund the development of a new cruiser model that shall help us protect our sea lanes ones they are built."
CEN_DEM_Military_Fleet_Expansion: "Military Fleet Expansion"
CEN_DEM_Military_Fleet_Expansion_desc: "To further our naval ambitions, we must focus on expanding our military fleet. It is wholly inadequate for our current strategic needs, which means that we must expand it. We must build new military ships to protect our convoys and safeguard our shores."
CEN_DEM_Civilian_Fleet_Focus: "Civilian Fleet Focus"
CEN_DEM_Civilian_Fleet_Focus_desc: "We have many goods to trade with the world and in order to expand our trade, we must build a strong and solid fleet. For this reason, we must focus on expanding our naval convoy fleet."
CEN_DEM_Fleet_Mainstay: "Fleet Mainstay"
CEN_DEM_Fleet_Mainstay_desc: "Our fleet may have destroyers and cruisers, but these ships might take a hit or two and will be forced to retreat to friendly ports. We need ships that can sustain heavier damage and continue the fight if we wish to stand a chance in a naval battle in the future."
CEN_DEM_Flagship_Designs: "Flagship Designs"
CEN_DEM_Flagship_Designs_desc: "With our reforms nearly finished, we are in dire need of a flagship for our navy. Not only due to its symbolical value, but because a flagship would become the sword and shield of our fleet, serving as a naval command platform to coordinate the rest of the fleet and as a formidable foe to any enemy ships in battle."

 CEN_foreign_design_desc: "Alors que nous étions occupés à réunir la Céntroamérique sous la bannière socialiste, nous nous sommes relâchés dans la recherche de nouvelles armes légères.

CEN_gotta_go_fast_desc: "Notre nation fait plus de 1500 km de long. Marcher ou utiliser des camions obsolètes n'est pas adapté à un pays de cette longueur. Nous devons investir dans de nouveaux équipements motorisés pour garantir que nous restons une armée dynamique".

### Events

 centro.001.t: "Fondation du Congrès centraméricain"
 centro.001.d: "Les socialistes de tout le pays se réunissent pour déterminer l'avenir et les fondements de la Céntroamérique socialiste unie ! Les plus éminents sont ceux qui ont le plus résisté aux divers dictateurs militaires et ennemis du socialisme, mais tous ne peuvent pas atteindre le sommet comme ils le souhaiteraient. Nous verrons dans les semaines à venir qui parviendra à se faire connaître"
 centro.001.a: "Vers un nouveau futur !"

 centro.002.t: "Partido Nacional Revolucionario"
 centro.002.d: "El Partido Nacional Revolucionario a été fondé par Sandino, et rassemble un petit groupe de Guatémaltèques sous sa coupe, laissant son ancien partenaire Moreno largement seul. Ils désirent une identité centraméricaine unifiée et souhaitent étendre cette identité et la révolution à une plus grande partie de l'Amérique latine. Beaucoup traitent Sandino de monstre pour avoir laissé Moreno, qui a été la pièce maîtresse de sa révolution au Nicaragua, dans la boue, mais sa popularité ne cesse de croître".
 centro.002.a: "Les scissions commencent à se faire sentir."

 centro.003.t: "Partido Maximista"
 centro.003.d: "Venancia Callejas a formé le Partido Maximista. Sa vision est celle d'un président fort, qui mène la Céntroamérique vers un avenir brillant, en diffusant sa vision du socialisme dans toute l'Amérique latine. Avec sa principale et unique base de soutien réelle située au Honduras, il est considéré comme un candidat peu susceptible de s'imposer dans l'avenir de notre nouvelle nation, mais il affirme qu'il "pourrait bien nous surprendre"
 centro.003.a: "Un parti très dangereux en effet..."

 centro.004.t: "Partido Sindicalista"
 centro.004.d: "Le Partido Sindicalista, dirigé par Agustín Martí, est fondé sur les idéaux du syndicalisme européen, créé par les Britanniques et les Français. Ils veulent fournir un gouvernement par et pour le peuple ; un lieu sûr pour les générations futures et surtout les indigènes, car une grande partie de leur base de soutien provient de la population indigène située au sein de notre syndicat. Outre le soutien général des indigènes, Martí est admiré dans son pays d'origine, le Salvador, qui le considère comme leur libérateur".
 centro.004.a: "Le modèle européen pourrait fonctionner après tout..."

 centro.005.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.005.d: "Le Partido Popular, dirigé par Silverio Ortiz, veut prendre un virage modéré. S'assurer que les gens ont de la nourriture dans le ventre et reçoivent l'éducation dont ils ont besoin. Il est considéré par certains comme trop modéré et pourrait se heurter à la résistance de personnes qui pensent ne pas suivre le vrai socialisme. En tant que parti basé au Guatemala, ils espèrent s'assurer que les Maximistas ne peuvent pas lutter pour le contrôle même s'ils ne gagnent pas, en affirmant qu'ils sont une plus grande menace que les dictateurs militaires avant eux".
 centro.005.a: "Un homme du peuple !"

 centro.006.t: "Partido Popular"
 centro.006.d: "Le Partido Popular, dirigé par Rafael Caleron, vise à sauver son peuple du manque d'abondance, veut mettre en place un meilleur système de santé. Aux opposants, qui l'accusent de s'adresser aux libéraux, il répond que sa forme unique de socialisme modéré permettra au pays de rester intact, de fonctionner et de vivre"
 centro.006.a: "Un homme du peuple !"

 centro.007.t: "Moreno, les objets trouvés"
 centro.007.d: "Laissé dans la poussière par Sandino, Moreno cherche un nouveau foyer dans le spectre politique. Beaucoup prédisent qu'il va être contraint à la subordination sous Sandino, mais d'autres pensent qu'il pourrait le poignarder dans le dos pour sa trahison et rejoindre les Guatémaltèques au sein du Partido Popular. Tout est possible, mais il décide de se ranger du côté de..."
 centro.007.a: "Il les fait basculer vers le Partido Nacional Revolucionario !"
 centro.007.b: "Il rend le Partido Popular très attrayant !"

 centro.008.t: "Appel du Congrès"
 centro.008.d: "Des représentants de tout le pays sont arrivés et se préparent à entamer les grands débats dans une semaine !"
 centro.008.a: "Commençons."

 centro.009.t: "Statut du pouvoir"
 centro.009.d: "Le Congrès ou le Président. Certains affirment que le pouvoir ne devrait jamais être détenu par un seul homme, d'autres soutiennent que toute nation a besoin d'une figure de proue, qui puisse la diriger pendant les périodes sombres. Après de nombreux jours de débat, les parties se sont finalement mises d'accord sur une réponse".
 centro.009.a: "Le congrès restera toujours important."
 centro.009.b: "Le président est le facteur final."

 centro.010.t: "Le statut de l'armée"
 centro.010.d: "Une union de nations pose quelques problèmes : chacune avait sa propre armée, sa propre structure. Doivent-ils tous être incorporés dans une seule grande force, une armée professionnelle, ou doivent-ils rester séparés, une bande de milices réparties dans tout le pays et travaillant de manière plus autonome" ?
 centro.010.a: "Les milices sont nos propres racines !"
 centro.010.b: "Peut-être qu'il est temps de créer une armée unifiée !"

 centro.011.t: "État de l'industrie"
 centro.011.d: "Si la révolution industrielle est loin derrière nous, nous n'avons pas encore entièrement basculé. Certains demandent que cela ne change jamais, et que l'on se concentre sur le fait de devenir la corbeille à pain socialiste, en s'assurant d'avoir le ventre plein. D'autres proposent un changement plus radical pour l'industrialisation, arguant que moins de gens ont besoin de travailler dans les champs de nos jours et plus peuvent travailler dans les usines, produisant des produits de luxe et des armes !"
 centro.011.a: "Pour un avenir plus fort, l'industrialisation !"
 centro.011.b: "Pour un meilleur peuple, le paysan !"

 centro.012.t: "Statut des futures élections"
 centro.012.d: "Si les gens travaillent dans les usines et les champs, ils ne peuvent pas s'occuper de politique, c'est du moins le raisonnement des Maximistas et des Sindicalistas. D'autres soutiennent que, quoi qu'il arrive, le peuple doit voter, car c'est lui qu'il représente. Sinon, que sont-ils, sinon des imposteurs de la révolution !"
 centro.012.a: "Le conseil est l'épine dorsale de l'union."
 centro.012.b: "Le peuple est le véritable décideur ici !"

 centro.013.t: "Les Maximistas ont gagné !"
 centro.013.d: "Les résultats sont là ! Les Maximistas ont prouvé qu'ils étaient les vainqueurs des élections et ont déjà commencé à mettre en œuvre leurs réformes controversées. Avec cela, on peut s'attendre à une centralisation du pouvoir à laquelle résistent d'autres cliques socialistes".
 centro.013.a: "Victoire !"

 centro.014.t: "Les Sindicalistes ont gagné !"
 centro.014.d: "Les résultats sont là ! Le Partido Sindicalista s'est retrouvé en tête du congrès, et a déjà commencé à prendre ses fonctions sous la direction de Martí. Les acclamations de ceux qui veulent que Centroamerica joue un plus grand rôle dans la politique socialiste sont très fortes, surtout de la part de la population autochtone. Mais il reste à voir ce qui va suivre"
 centro.014.a: "Pour le socialisme !"

 centro.015.t: "Les révolutionnaires ont gagné !"
 centro.015.d: "Les résultats sont là ! Le Partido Nacional Revolucionario est arrivé en tête de notre nation, comme beaucoup semblaient l'attendre. Sandino a toujours été un choix populaire parmi le peuple en raison de son succès initial au Nicaragua, et beaucoup s'attendent à ce qu'il ne soit pas si différent maintenant. La suite de sa carrière politique n'est pas encore connue, mais beaucoup la regardent avec impatience".
 centro.015.a: "Pour la révolution !"

 centro.016.t: "Les Moderados ont gagné !"
 centro.016.d: "Les résultats sont là ! Aussi socialistes qu'on puisse l'être sans entrer dans le camp libéral, les Moderados souhaitent que le peuple soit le principal décideur au sein de notre nouvelle union face aux petits politiciens, tout en assurant leur sécurité et la satisfaction de leurs besoins quotidiens. D'autres politiciens regardent avec mépris ce qu'ils considèrent comme de sales modérés, mais aujourd'hui, c'est le peuple qui se réjouit".
 centro.016.a: "Pour le peuple !"

 centro.017.t: "Impasse !"
 centro.017.d: "Après des semaines de débats, le congrès n'a pas réussi à désigner un vainqueur clair. Un autre vote devra être organisé, avec un résultat plus clair, espérons-le. Qui remporte le nouveau résultat ?"
 centro.017.a: "Les Moderados."
 centro.017.b: "Les Maximistas."
 centro.017.c: "Les Sindicalistes."
 centro.017.e: "Les révolutionnaires".

 centro.018.t: "Le débat sur le capital".
 centro.018.d: "Une nouvelle nation a besoin d'une, éventuellement, nouvelle capitale. Nous devons décider si nous voulons déplacer notre capitale vers un nouveau lieu, plus adapté à notre nouveau gouvernement, ou si nous allons rester sur place. En fin de compte, c'est le nouveau congrès qui décide et son choix vient de quitter les portes !"
 centro.018.a: "San Salvador fera l'affaire."
 centro.018.b: "Tegucigalpa fera bien."
 centro.018.c: "Le Guatemala fera l'affaire."
 centro.018.e: "Managua fera bien."
 centro.018.f: "San José fera l'affaire".

 centro.019.t: "Notre financement ?"
 centro.019.d: "Nous ne pouvons pas reconstruire un pays sur de simples promesses.\n\nIl faut que quelque part nous obtenions les fonds nécessaires à nos vastes projets. Nous pouvons ouvrir nos propres coffres, mais nous avons plus de factures à payer, donc si nous voulons éviter de dépenser encore plus d'argent, nous pourrions nous approprier certaines usines de leurs propriétaires pour nous donner plus de biens à utiliser, cependant, cela ne rendra pas les gens aussi heureux"
 centro.019.a: "Nous devrons ouvrir les caisses".
 centro.019.b: "Nous pouvons juste emprunter quelques usines."

 centro.020.t: "Pour les "sales" Moderados ?"
 centro.020.d: "Certains parmi nous pensent que nous devrions sympathiser davantage avec les autres factions, et essayer d'intégrer leurs idées aux nôtres. D'autres qualifient cette idée de sale, et appellent ceux qui les tiennent de "sales" modérés. Nous pourrions essayer d'être plus inclusifs, de nous donner un peu de stabilité, au prix de la colère des Moderados actuels, ou nous pourrions simplement les ignorer et essayer d'expulser les personnes qui défendent cette idée".
 centro.020.a: "On les traite de sales pour une raison."
 centro.020.b: "Nous gouvernons pour tout le monde !"

 centro.021.t: "Enfin, la prospérité !"
 centro.021.d: "Nos nouvelles politiques ont porté leurs fruits ! Notre travail acharné pour améliorer les conditions de vie porte ses fruits, mais nous sommes loin d'avoir terminé. Si nous pouvons nous concentrer sur l'ensemble de la nation, il serait peut-être préférable de se concentrer sur un seul État. Cela pourrait mettre en colère certains des États laissés pour compte, mais se traduira par des améliorations plus importantes..."
 centro.021.a: "Se concentrer davantage sur le Guatemala."
 centro.021.b: "Se concentrer davantage sur le Nicaragua."
 centro.021.c: " Se concentrez davantage sur le Salvador. "
 centro.021.e: " Se concentrer davantage sur le Honduras. "
 centro.021.f: " Se concentrer davantage sur le Costa Rica ! "
 centro.021.g: " Se concentrer sur le pays tout entier ! "

 centro.022.t: "Un travail acharné qui paie"
 centro.022.d: "Le travail que nous avons accompli il y a des mois porte enfin ses fruits. Les gens de [CEN_prosper_state.GetName] se réjouissent de l'ouverture des nouvelles usines aujourd'hui !"
 centro.022.a: "Ah, les fruits du travail."

 centro.023.t: "Les disciples de Sandino"
 centro.023.d: "De plus en plus de gens suivent les paroles de Sandino, qui ne conviennent pas à une nation socialiste...\n\nIls se font appeler les Sandiniastas, et se font de plus en plus entendre pour soutenir Sandino plutôt que le gouvernement. Nous devons décider si nous devons arrêter cela dans sa course, ou si nous devons le laisser continuer et risquer que cela devienne incontrôlable..."
 centro.023.a: "Freinez sa croissance !"
 centro.023.b: "Laissez-le s'amuser !"

 centro.024.t: "Résistance au changement"
 centro.024.d: "Le progrès ne va pas sans sacrifices. Nous devons purger toutes les influences non hispaniques qui nous freinent actuellement. Il y a eu une certaine résistance à nos avancées. Nous pourrions les faire taire et avancer sur notre chemin, ou nous pourrions les écouter, et aller un peu plus lentement..."
 centro.024.a: "Ils devront vivre avec."
 centro.024.b: "Peut-être que nous devrions les écouter."

 centro.025.t: "Hispanisation de l'Amérique centrale"
 centro.025.d: "La Céntroamérique a fait des progrès inquiétants vers l'hispanisation, en forçant les mariages à être brisés, en expulsant les immigrants et en interdisant toute tradition qui ne fait pas partie de la culture hispanique.\n\nBeaucoup dans notre nation regardent avec des yeux fatigués vers le sud, et attendent une dénonciation..."
 centro.025.a: "Dénoncez-le."
 centro.025.b: "Pas notre problème."

 centro.026.t: "Le problème au nord !"
 centro.026.d: "Pendant trop longtemps, nous, les Céntro-Américains, avons toléré [MEX.GetName]. Maintenant qu'ils ont revêtu une casquette autoritaire, nous ne pouvons plus tolérer cela. Nous devons frapper rapidement, car sinon nous pourrions nous retrouver à la fin d'une guerre perdue avec [MEX.GetName]..."
 centro.026.a: "Nous pouvons nous préparer à la guerre !"

 centro.027.t: "Le culte de Sandino s'accroît"
 centro.027.d: "Nous avons été négligents, et les Sandiniastas ont gagné de plus en plus d'adeptes...\n\nNous pouvons encore agir, et interdire l'organisation, mais cela nous coûtera beaucoup, et cela mettra Sandino encore plus en colère. Cependant, si nous ne le faisons pas, Sandino pourrait avoir des idées et essayer de s'attirer encore plus de pouvoir, ce qui mettrait en danger la révolution... Nous devons décider rapidement !"
 centro.027.a: "Il est trop puissant maintenant..."
 centro.027.b: "Dénichons-le pour la dernière fois !"

 centro.028.t: "La question autochtone"
 centro.028.d: "Il y a des gens sur ces terres depuis longtemps. Les indigènes ont regardé le nouveau congrès, ne sachant pas trop quoi en penser. Un représentant est venu nous voir il y a quelques jours, à la recherche d'une déclaration sur leur statut.\n\nS'ils étaient encore respectés et considérés comme des citoyens à part entière ? Nous leur avons donné une réponse rapide : "
 centro.028.a: "Nous accueillons les nouveaux et les anciens résidents !"
 centro.028.b: "Nous n'avons pas besoin de vous !"

 centro.029.t: "L'identité centraméricaine"
 centro.029.d: "En accueillant les indigènes à bras ouverts, les relations se sont beaucoup réchauffées. Un groupe d'indigènes a pris l'initiative et a formé l'identité centraméricaine. Ils répandent l'idée que nous sommes tous centraméricains, et non guatémaltèques, nicaraguayens ou salvadoriens, ce qui apportera sûrement une plus grande unité à notre nation !"
 centro.029.a: "Nous représentons tous les centraméricains."

 centro.030.t: "Commerce européen"
 centro.030.d: "Si nous voulons améliorer notre commerce et aller au-delà de notre propre continent, nous devrons établir des connexions au sein de l'Europe. Nous enverrons des ambassadeurs commerciaux pour essayer de trouver une nation désireuse d'établir des liens commerciaux et nous espérons qu'une fois qu'une nation aura été influencée, d'autres suivront".
 centro.030.a: "Établissons des routes commerciales".

 centro.031.t: "Les Moderados résistent !"
 centro.031.d: "Les membres des Moderados descendent dans la rue pour protester contre nos récentes politiques. Ils prétendent que nous leur enlevons la liberté d'expression, que nous ne représentons pas la véritable révolution et que nous leur faisons des déclarations plus absurdes qu'ils ne pourront jamais prouver !"
 centro.031.a: "Nous dirigeons, et nous dirigeons seuls."

CENmil_central_american_highway_1_desc: "As levels of prosperity increase in Central America, more and more people will be able to afford private cars, and as such we will need more roadways across the nation. A highway from Quetzaltenango to Managua will be the axis of our road system."
CENmil_central_american_highway_2: "The Southern Central American Highway"
CENmil_central_american_highway_2_desc: "The Central American Highway has become a vital infrastructural axis in the Northern parts of Central America, however the highway stops in Managua which limits its ability to be the main road axis of Central America.

We shall do right what our ancestors did wrong, and our union shall stretch from the Mexican border to the Colombian, like it should be!"
CENmil_core_british_honduras: "Integrate Belize"
 CENmil_core_british_honduras_desc: "The former British colony of Belize has resisted our attempts of integration so far. However, as the West Indies Federation now recognises that it can't recapture their colony, the people of Belize have no choice but to surrender to our administration."
CEN_core_matagalpa: "Reintegrate Eastern Nicaragua"
CEN_core_matagalpa_desc: "The Eastern provinces of Nicaragua have resisted our attempts of introducing conscription into the area. Due to the chaos in the aftermath of the end of the American occupation and the following Nicaraguan revolution, the region is still not under our full administrative control."

As the Nicaraguan Revolution has finally come to an end and as the borders between our nations disappear, our Union shall remain a bastion of freedom and liberty, under guidance of the strongmen of the military.\n\nWe, as an union of nations, shall stand united against Syndicalism and everything that threatens our way of life."
cenmil.1.a: "Long live the Republic!"

cenmil.2.t: "The New Union"
 cenmil.2.d: "Ever since the Federal Republic of Central America collapsed in 1843, there has been no successful attempt at reuniting Central America under a single flag.\n\nAs the disease called Syndicalism spreads throughout the world, even Central America isn't saved. Nicaragua, which has fallen victim to the Internationale's promises, has become the epicentre for Syndicalism in Central America, aided by the Mexicans.\n\nIn order to save Central America from Syndicalism, Guatemala and El Salvador have signed a treaty of unification that shall create an anti-Syndicalist fortress. It is our duty to expand southward, and to destroy the remains of Syndicalism in our hemisphere."
cenmil.2.a: "Long live the Republic!"

cenmil.3.t: "Opening of the Military Congress"
 cenmil.3.d: "With Central America reorganised and unified, it is now time to choose a new regime to lead us into the future! For this purpose, the militaries of the former Central American states have met for a first session today in the President's Palace in Guatemala City. The Military Congress of Central America will be tasked with writing a new constitution for our Union as well as select ministers and a new President."
cenmil.3.a: "Long Live the Republic!"

cenmil.4.t: "The Economy of Central America"
 cenmil.4.d.yes.martinez: "Ever since the first American businessmen landed in Costa Rica, the United Fruit Company and many other foreign companies and investors have controlled our economies. However, with the revolution in Nicaragua and the political chaos that reigned in the Northern nations, the economy has been severely damage and is strongly weakened. Now that the revolution has been suppressed and that the political situation has stabilised, the Congress needs to decide on an unified economic plan and a head minister in charge of the reforms.\nBoth supporters of laissez-faire capitalism, the AM has suggested Juan Manuel Gálvez and the PU has suggested Aldana Sandoval to this position, while the PN has suggested the interventionist Joaquín Valdéz."

cenmil.5.d.yes.martinez: "As a newly formed nation, our Republic will need to quickly align itself on the world stage. While we will remain with our old allies in the United States and in the anti-Syndicalists factions, we must quickly take action to establish favourable deals. As the foreign ministry holds large power due to how influential foreign powers are in our nation, the factions are fighting hard to get the position.\nAbraham Williams Calderón is the AM's candidate, Juan Federico Ponce Vaides that of the PU and Salvador Peña Trejo is running for the PN."

cenmil.6.t: "A new Head for the Interior Ministry"
 cenmil.6.d.yes.martinez: "Despite the major internal threats and problems that the young Republic has to face at the moment, we still don't possess an organised, centralised institute that defends our way of life. As we can't rely on the unorganised police forces of the former nations to handle things forever, we need to reform our interior ministry. The ministry will need a head to run the show, and such an influential position is highly wanted.\nCarlos Hartling runs for the AM, Francisco Javier Arana is the PU's candidate, and the PN has brought forth Fidel Cristino Garay."

cenmil.7.t: "Somoza's Speech"
 cenmil.7.d: "Anastasio Somoza García, leader of the Administración Militar, the moderate faction of the military congress, has taken to the balcony of the President's Palace of Guatemala to hold a speech in front of a large crowd. As many military men have feared, he wishes to use the fact that his faction is the most moderate to convince the population of his cause, even though he doesn't actively practice what he preaches.\n\nDespite the warnings and threats made by the more radical PU and PN, the speech has also been transmitted via radio.\n\n'People of Guatemala, people of El Salvador, people of Honduras, people of Nicaragua, now we are all people of the Central American Republic. Syndicalists have tried to oppress us, but no more! Our nation is now free of the Syndicalist menace, thanks to the efforts of every single Central American patriot. Now that the holy task has been completed, your voice should be heard, and will be heard!'\n\nOn the next meeting, the military congress was so angry at Somoza that multiple congressmen took to the podium and screamed that Somoza should be court-martialled for high treason."
cenmil.7.a: "Maybe his ideas aren't that wrong..."
 cenmil.7.b: "Somoza needs to be court-martialled indeed!"

cenmil.8.t: "Reforming the Army"
 cenmil.8.d.yes.martinez: "The military has been the driving force behind the unification of Central America, but to spell it in singular is quite wrong. Due to the differences between the former nations of Central America, our army is currently a chaotic mix and depending on what nationality you have, you follow different military doctrines and use different equipment. The army currently has none less than 5 different modifications of the Mauser rifle in use!\nThe AM and the PN have both presented plans to regularise and professionalise the armed forces, meanwhile the PU has suggested a major militarisation policy to expand the army as much as possible to defend the union."

cenmil.9.t: "Maximiliano Hernandez' Speech"
 cenmil.9.d: "Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, the leader of the Partido Nacional, the most radical faction in the congress, has reserved an hour of speech time in front of the congress. Known for his immense hate for Syndicalists and opponents in general, he is most (in)famous for his actions in the 1932 peasant uprising.\n\n'Dear Congressmen, dear men who have let us to victory against the godless Syndicalist, the crusade against Syndicalism is not over! Our Mexican neighbours suffer from an extensive case of Syndicalism, and our neighbours to the south are being tempted into the hands of the Internationale. As a beacon of liberty and prosperity, the Central American Republic needs a powerful, strong and unifying leader to lead us in the eternal struggle against the godless traitors! Our men will fight in the jungle, in the hills, in the mountains and in the cities, and we will never surrender to those who wish the foundations of society destroyed!'"
cenmil.9.a: "Martinez will lead us to victory!"
cenmil.9.b: "Martinez will lead us to ruins..."

cenmil.10.t: "Jorge Ubico holds a Patriotic Speech"
cenmil.10.d.yes.martinez: "Maximiliano Hernandez' speech has left quite an impression on the members of the congress, however not everyone was happy with his terms and conditions. Jorge Ubico, the leader of the Partido de Unificación, has written his own speech to counter Hernandez', and has presented it in front of the congress, while also transmitting it to the entire Union via radio.\n\n'Central America has been often seen as backwards by the outside world. Our roads have been described as lethal, our nations as corrupt and violent, and our economies as inefficient and underdeveloped.\nNo longer, the glorious Union and shall prove to the world that Central America is the land of the brave, strong and innovative! No longer will we suffer under the traitorous Syndicalist regimes, no longer will we suffer from corrupt officials, no longer will we suffer under division!\nWe need a strong, powerful regime, with a strong powerful leader, to finally reach the future, so to every congressman, to every citizen of the Union, to everyone I say, I will bring prosperity to our glorious Union! Only the brave and strong will achieve greatness, only those with willpower will go down in history, only those who lead their nation to glory will be remembered forever!\n\nThe Central American Republic shall march towards civilisation!

cenmil.11.t: "Voting Commences"
cenmil.11.d: "For multiple weeks the Military Congress of Central America has been meeting in Guatemala City to discuss and decide the future of the Union. Speeches, arguments, disputes and bribery have been common place in order to convince (or force) congressmen to join and vote for one of the factions, and the three strongmen who lead them respectively have been doing their best to secure as many votes as possible. The last meeting of the congress will be held in a few days, and it will decide the future of the Union as the new president will be elected to lead."

cenmil.13.d: "An One-Party State, as the name implies, has to be dominated and controlled by a single party. It will be an easy task to get rid of the democratic and syndicalist opposition, however the other military factions will not surrender. Now that we have been victorious in the Congress, we will need to get rid of our opponents..."
cenmil.13.a: "Destroy them."
cenmil.13.b: "The military sticks together!"

cenmil.14.t: "Military Rivalries Appear"
 cenmil.14.d: "It seems as that our move to destroy opposition inside the military has left it disorganised and split. Despite careful planning, many brigades have declared their loyalty to their former commanders before the unification has been completed."
cenmil.14.a: "Dismiss the disloyal brigades."

cenmil.15.t: "Dedicate More Manpower to the Police?"
 cenmil.15.d: "With the passing of the new, harsher laws, we're now finding ourselves with a dismal lack of police officers to enforce them. While we could draw from our Army's manpower pool to resolve this issue, it may just fan the flames of civilian discontent who may see this as a militarisation of the police."

cenmil.15.b: "No, We Don't Need to Anger the Public Further"

cenmil.16.t: "The Civilian Puppet State"
cenmil.16.d: "The AM has been victorious in the congress thanks to the major support from the population, however now they expect us to fulfil our promises. Betraying them would risk an open rebellion, however Somoza has never actually planned to hand over any power to the civilian population. In order to avoid a second revolution, a civilian state has to be created, while being controlled by the military. However, in order to achieve legitimacy, how much are we willing to negotiate with the civilian politicians?"
cenmil.16.a: "Lift the ban on opposition parties but only approve loyal politicians."
cenmil.16.b: "Permit some civilian opposition but only led be controllable politicians."
cenmil.16.c: "Solidify our power with bribes and threats!"

cenmil.17.t: "Presidential Elections"
cenmil.17.d: "The people do not seem satisfied by the liberties and freedoms we have given to them, as they are demonstrating in favour of new elections. However, unlike the congress election, the people want to vote themselves and decide their own president. Those demands are quite crazy, but we shouldn't risk a second revolution.\n\nAfter countless hours of voting and waiting, the election bureaus have finally closed their doors and the votes have been revealed to the election commission. There has been no reported incidents of bribery or election rigging... at least none that the military would permit to be reported."

 cenmil.36.d: "The Partido de Unificación under the leadership of General Jorge Ubico Castañeda has solidified their position in charge of the Central American Republic.\n\nUbico, now the first president of the Union, has been forced to combat Syndicalist revolutionaries, democratic agitators and traitors in the military, however he has proven his adamancy and his incorruptibility during the times of troubles that now lie behind us. Jorge Ubico, who has often referred to himself as the Napoleon of Central America, has proven to the citizens of Central America that he is ready to 'march towards civilisation', as he had promised during his most famous radio transmission. Crowds have gathered today in Guatemala City for the inauguration of Jorge Ubico, and throughout the Union, the same sentence could be heard..."
cenmil.36.a: "Long Live Jorge Ubico, Long Live the Republic!"

cenmil.37.t: "Jorge Ubico travels the Union"
cenmil.37.d: "As a true president of the people, Jorge Ubico has announced today that he will be travelling across Central America, visiting every larger and smaller city as well as the beautiful country sides of the Union. He will be crossing the Union by car and plane, in order to be able to meet as many citizens of the Republic and to so that he can see every corner of our beautiful union. He will be leaving today for Quetzaltenango, after which he will continue to the disputed region of Belize. Along his route, which has been published in all major newspapers of the Union, crowds of cheerful and loyal citizens have gathered in order to see and meet the president personally."
cenmil.37.a: "Onwards!"

cenmil.38.t: "Jorge Ubico arrives in Belize"
 cenmil.38.d: "On the second destination of his tour of the Republic, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Belize City.\n\nBelize, a former British colony under control of Guatemala and later the Central American Republic since the collapse of the British Empire, has remain a claim of the West Indies Federation, despite being no longer under British control for almost two decades. Jorge Ubico's visit, which was greeted with a flood of Republican flags, proves that the people of Belize truly feel as a part of the Union, and not part of the rotten federation across the sea.\n\nThe next destination is the Honduran border city of San Pedro Sula, which now is the main Atlantic port of Central America."
cenmil.38.a: "Ubico truly unites our Republic."

cenmil.39.t: "Jorge Ubico crosses the Honduran country side"
cenmil.39.d: "Honduras, the former bastion against the Syndicalist traitors of Nicaragua, has suffered under the status of frontier against an hostile force. The country side is the home to much of the poor population of Honduras, who can just keep themselves over water with the little they have. Jorge Ubico, who is currently travelling from San Pedro Sula towards Matagalpa, Nicaragua, has taken a major detour to visit as much of rural Honduras as possible. No matter where he arrives, the commonly illiterate citizens greet him with the utmost respect and hospitality, waving the Republican flag along his route. Jorge Ubico has promised to aid every man, woman and child of Central America, no matter their social class or rank, and has kept his promise along the way. By listening to the needs and demands of the common man, Ubico has gained much popularity in the country side, which will aid him in his 'march towards civilisation'."
cenmil.39.a: "How could anyone not support Ubico?"

cenmil.40.t: "Syndicalist traitors attack Ubico!"
 cenmil.40.d: "On route towards Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, a group of Syndicalist traitors and terrorists have attempted to ambush Ubico, and end the life of our great president!\n\nLuckily, the Syndicalists, just like their ideology, were not smart enough to cover up their plans, and have been discovered by brave loyalists! As the group of traitors was preparing to ambush the president's car using multiple French rifles, loyalist police forces have overwhelmed and arrested the terrorists. Jorge Ubico and his companions have not been present during the combat between the loyalists and traitors, and as such have not been hurt.\n\nDespite the risks that Ubico has taken, travelling in an open top car through the homeland of Central American Syndicalism, no threatening attacks have happened so far."
cenmil.40.a: "Good Riddance."

cenmil.41.t: "Jorge Ubico crosses El Salvador by train"
cenmil.41.d: "The railway, the symbol of the industrialisation and of westernisation, only passes through limited parts of Central America. One of the largest tracks are located in El Salvador, connecting the ports of Acajutla and Cutuco and passing through San Salvador and San Miguel. Today, a special train has carried Jorge Ubico from San Miguel to the Salvadorian capital. Stopping in Usulutan, Zacatecoluga, San Vincente and other stations along the railway, at each point has he been greeted by cheerful crowds and the Republican flag. Upon his arrival in San Salvador, he announced that he will be providing more funding and incentives for a Trans-Central American railway, which will also be open for civilian transportation."
cenmil.41.a: "The railway will be a cornerstone of the March Towards Civilisation."

cenmil.42.t: "Jorge Ubico is back in Guatemala City"
cenmil.42.d: "After more than a month of touring Central America, visiting all corners of the Union and all social classes, Jorge Ubico has arrived in Guatemala City. The tour has proven to be a genius marketing stunt, and Jorge Ubico's popularity has increased drastically throughout all regions of the Union. In front of the presidential palace, a massive crowd has greeted Jorge Ubico, who later made a radio broadcasted speech. During the tour, Ubico has promised many reforms, and the people are convinced that he will go through with all of them."
cenmil.42.a: "Welcome Back!"

cenmil.43.t: "Jorge Ubico's Statue is completed"
 cenmil.43.d: "President Jorge Ubico, the hero of the Guatemalan Civil War, the saviour Central America from the Syndicalist traitors, will now forever watch the President's Palace.\n\nThe construction of his statue, which dominates the plaza in front of the palace, has been started when the Guatemalan flag was still on top of the palace's flag pole, when Central America was still divided due to the Syndicalist traitors.\n\nHowever now, the beautiful flag of the united Republic is guarding the entrance of the palace, all thanks to our hero, Jorge Ubico. The inauguration, on this beautiful day of June, has been declared a holiday so that all workers, students and intellectuals of Central America have the possibility of honouring our great leader.\n\nThe crowds which have gathered to see the statue are estimated at more than twenty thousand brave citizens, and the Republican flag is waving in every street of Guatemala City on this blessed day."
cenmil.43.a: "An impressive statue for an impressive leader."

cenmil.200.t: "Supporting a side in the Civil War"
cenmil.200.d: "The United States of America have fallen into a second civil war, more destructive than the first one. Central America has always been deeply connected with the United States due to the United Fruit Company and similar businesses, however the military is divided on who to help. Some are advocating to aid the official United States government, while others would rather support the new American Union State. Depending on which side we choose, the victory or defeat of said faction could have severe consequences."
cenmil.200.a: "Help the official regime!"
cenmil.200.b: "Support the Union State!"

cenmil.201.t: "The Central American Republic asks for protection"
 cenmil.201.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to our nation to protect it from their enemies who threaten the integrity and survival of the Republic. Accepting their request would ultimately lead to them joining our faction, however committing ourselves to their defence could upset the already fragile balance of power of the region."
cenmil.201.a: "Guarantee their Independence."
cenmil.201.b: "Where is Central America again?"

cenmil.202.t: "The Central American Republic asks to join our faction"
cenmil.202.d: "The Central American Republic has put forth a request to join our military faction. While we could receive an additional ally who could potentially control the Panama Canal in the future, the balance of power of the region could be destroyed through such a move."
cenmil.202.a: "Accept their Demand."
cenmil.202.b: "Central America is by Brazil, right?"

cenmil.203.t: "The Status of Belize"
cenmil.203.d: "Occupied during the British Revolution of 1925, British Honduras, or as it is now known as Belize, has been part of Guatemala ever since. Now that Guatemala has evolved into the Central American Republic, Belize remains a part of our nation. However, the British, better said the West Indies Federation, still claim Belize as a rightful part of their nation, which renders the full integration of Belize impossible. Our only possibility to set up ties with the Entente is to return the land, but this would severely hurt our international prestige. Keeping will however forever lock us from the Entente."
cenmil.203.a: "Return Belize."
cenmil.203.b: "Offer a Deal to the Federation."

cenmil.204.t: "Central America demands that we revoke our Belizean claim"
 cenmil.204.d: "The Central American government has sent us a deal concerning the former colony of Belize. They demand that we renounce our claim on Belize and recognise its ownership by Central America, and in exchange our two nations will sign favourable trade deals to revive business ties."
cenmil.204.a: "Accept the Deal."
cenmil.204.b: "Crazy and unacceptable terms!"

cenmil.205.t: "The Federation has refused our terms!"
cenmil.205.d: "The West Indies Federation have refused to revoke their claim on Belize and have called our terms crazy and unacceptable!"
cenmil.205.a: "Back off and maintain the Status-Quo."
cenmil.205.b: "Place an Embargo on the Federation!"

cenmil.206.t: "Central America embargoes us!"
cenmil.206.d: "Angry about our adamant position concerning the status of Belize, the Central American government has placed an embargo against us! They have promised to improve trade ties, but now they have made the opposite. While this will hurt both of our economies, giving in now would be a political humiliation."
cenmil.206.a: "We will have to accept their terms."
cenmil.206.b: "What is there even to trade with Central America?"

cenmil.207.t: "The Federation has cut all ties with us!"
cenmil.207.d: "The West Indies Federation has ignored our warnings, and is now ignoring our embargo! It seems like the dispute over Belize will never end..."
cenmil.207.a: "Maintain the Embargo."

cenmil.208.t: "The Federation has revoked their claim!"
cenmil.208.d: "The West Indies Federation has finally accepted to revoke their claims on Belize, which will open the path for its full integration."
cenmil.208.a: "Great!"

cenmil.209.t: "Our request has been accepted"
cenmil.209.d: "We have secured the guarantee we have requested and now are protected from the enemies of the Republic."

cenmil.210.t: "Our request has been denied"
cenmil.210.d: "We have failed to secure the guarantee we have requested and now remain alone against the enemies of the Republic."

cenmil.211.d: "We have been formally accepted into the faction and can now participate in the international crusade against Syndicalism!"
cenmil.211.a: "Great!"

cenmil.212.t: "Our request has been denied"
cenmil.212.d: "We have not been accepted into the faction, but we will continue our struggle against Syndicalism on our own."
cenmil.212.a: "Disappointing."

cenmil.220.t: "The Status of the IRCA"
cenmil.220.d: "The International Railways of Central America, short IRCA, has held the monopoly on rail transportation and the ownership of most railway tracks in Central America since 1912. The IRCA, now part of the United Fruit Company, will be a major partner or obstacle in our quest to lay the railway from Guatemala to Panama. Previous Guatemalan administrations have signed various deals with the IRCA, and it is now up to us if we respect these signatures or break the deals in favour of a state-controlled railway."
cenmil.220.a: "Grant them a monopoly as long as they follow our orders."
cenmil.220.b: "Respect the previous deals."
cenmil.220.c: "Nationalize the IRCA."

cenmil.221.t: "The Planning of the Railway"
cenmil.221.d: "Building a railway across the harsh terrain of Central America is not an easy task, and a proper railway suited for all kinds of transportation needs will be very expensive. As the Trans-Central American railway is a major prestige project for the government, some advocate that the government takes over the entire cost of the railway. While very costly, that would also guarantee state control of the rails. At the same time, foreign investors are also interested in the construction of the railway and could take over part of the costs."
cenmil.221.a: "Let the investors handle the costs."

 cenmil.222.d: "While the expansion of the already existing IRCA tracks was relatively cheap, the extension towards Tegucigalpa has proven to be very costly. The budget planned for this section has already been exceeded and the railway is still a long distance from the Honduran city. The hilly terrain has caused major delays, and now the construction organisers are asking for additional funding."

In order to get our men back, we were forced to pay the ransom, and the Syndicalists are most likely using the money to buy up equipment for future operations."

We will gather representatives from the various armed forces of Central America to elect the first president."

The most radical military faction, Martinez' rule over El Salvador has already proven that he will transform the union into a powerful, centralised military state with no tolerance for opposition."
CENmil_catholic_union: "A Catholic Union"
CENmil_catholic_union_desc: "Many things divide the people of Central America; Nationalities like Honduran have already severely hurt the ideal of a Central American identity, and the Spanish language has not been able to mend the rifts that have formed along the national borders. However, what is shared by all Central Americans is their religion: Catholicism."
CENmil_speak_spanish: "Speak Spanish!"
CENmil_speak_spanish_desc: "Besides the Catholic faith, the nations of Central America share a common language: Spanish.

CENmil_trump_wall: "Tighter Border Controls"
CENmil_trump_wall_desc: "A major problem that the Guatemalan government had to face during the last decades was Mexican cross-border banditry, which would raid Guatemalan regions for their own gain. By enacting tight border controls with military patrols, we will be able to destroy those illegal activities, while also making sure that nothing enters Central America that isn't supposed to enter it."
 CENmil_centralized_union: "A Centralised Union"
 CENmil_centralized_union_desc: "The last century has shown that national divisions and borders between the various Central American countries has damaged the integrity of our region and has permitted for radical groups as Sandino's syndicalists to take over individual states. Power must be centralised with the central government, and no one expect the president shall have any power in our union."

However, one main selling point of Central America remains the very low wages, which permits e.g. American companies to produce much cheaper than in the US."

# Agriculture
CENmil_agricultural_dev: "Agricultural Development"
 CENmil_agricultural_dev_desc: "The agriculture sector of Central America remains the most important pillar of our economy, and the majority of foreign investments end up in our farms and plantations. We need to provide additional support in order to mechanise our agricultural sector and to improve the living conditions of our farmers."
CENmil_ufc_protecc: "Protect Corporate Assets"
CENmil_ufc_protecc_desc: "In the chaos that has followed from the Nicaraguan Revolution and the turmoil in the other nations of Central America, our corporate allies have come under serious attack by Syndicalist and liberal forces alike. We need to safeguard the corporate assets so that confidence can be re-established in our economy."
CENmil_ufc_attacc: "Further Land Grants"
CENmil_ufc_attacc_desc: "Foreign companies such as the United Fruit Company hold major influence, both economic and political, in our nation. By providing those companies with additional, tax-free land, they will support the policies of our current administration and increase the agricultural output of our nation."
 #CENmil_ufc_politicc: "Political Cooperation"
 #CENmil_ufc_politicc_desc: ""
CENmil_cash_crop_export: "Cash Crop Profits"
CENmil_cash_crop_export_desc: "Cash crops make up a significant part of our agricultural output and bring in large profits."
CENmil_efficent_plantations: "Efficient Plantations"
CENmil_efficent_plantations_desc: "Many of the plantations of Central America have a very low output as they use outdated farming methods and are set up in an inefficient way. With additional government funding and educational investments, we can massively increase the agricultural output of our economy."
CENmil_diverse_output: "Diverse Output"
CENmil_diverse_output_desc: "As in any economic sector, we cannot rely on a single type of crop. In case of price fluctuations or crop failure, we need to have a diverse agriculture to overcome the difficulties presented."

### Army
CENmil_army_investments: "Army Investments"
CENmil_army_investments_desc: "The army is the backbone of the entire Republic. The credit for the successful unification goes to our military, and they will protect and expand our Union forever. In order to strengthen the state and the armed forces, the defence budget needs to be drastically increased."

## Warfare with European Characteristics
CENmil_army_european: "European Doctrine"
 CENmil_army_european_desc: "The enemies that the Central American Republic faces aren't some unorganised guerrilla forces or an army consisting of a single division. Our enemies to the north and the south have powerful industrial bases, strong air forces and large armies. To defend our way of life, we need to adapt a modern, European doctrine."
CENmil_increase_firepower: "Standardised Equipment"
CENmil_increase_firepower_desc: "Our army currently operates a massive amount of diverse equipment, e.g. we currently use not one but multiple versions of the outdated Mauser rifle! In the chaos that is our military arsenal, nothing short of a massive standardisation program will be able to sort things out."
CENmil_standard_equi: "Heavy Guns"
 CENmil_standard_equi_desc: "Our army lacks heavy fire weapons despite the fact that artillery has proven to be decisive in the battles of the Weltkrieg. We need to rapidly equip our army with heavy guns and train specialised battalions to operate them."
CENmil_heavy_guns: "Motorisation Effort"
CENmil_heavy_guns_desc: "As we reform and expand our army, we are facing severe logistical issues. The terrain of Central America is rough and roads are rare, however we still need to get our artillery pieces from the factory or the port to our divisions on the border. Trucks will solve this problem."
CENmil_chain_command: "Reorganise Chain of Command"
 CENmil_chain_command_desc: "Just like our military arsenal, our chain of command is nothing short of anarchy. As we are in the process of integrating armies from multiple nations into one, which all had different doctrines and hierarchies, no one knows anymore who takes orders from who and who is on top. We need to fully reorganise the entire chain of command."
CENmil_trained_officers: "Trained Officers"
CENmil_trained_officers_desc: "Our army has a severe lack of low ranking officers, and in general, trained officers who know what they are doing is as rare as successful Syndicalism at the moment. An extensive enrolling and training program will be the first step to fix this terrible issue."
CENmil_border_exercises: "Border Exercises"
CENmil_border_exercises_desc: "The terrain of Central America is very rough and unforgiving, and it is badly mapped. By performing regular exercises and war games near our enemies' borders, we will know the terrain much better than the invaders and at the same time we will train our army."
CENmil_professional_soldiers: "Professional Soldiers"
CENmil_professional_soldiers_desc: "Regular conscripts may have the spirit and the will to fight, however when the first bullets are flying through the air, they will be hopelessly scared. A professional soldier on the other hand will remain calm and do his duty of defending his nation at all times."

## Central Army Tree
CENmil_industrial_warfare: "Industrial Warfare"
CENmil_industrial_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower pool, but an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up. Without a proper economy, no nation will be able to fight in the 20th century."
CENmil_mil_ind_complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
CENmil_mil_ind_complex_desc: "Our military and heavy industries are unable to fully equip and supply our army. The government will need to step in to increase the capacity of the military industrial complex so that every soldier will get the rifle and helmet he needs."
CENmil_scientific_warfare: "Scientific Warfare"
CENmil_scientific_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, or an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, but an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics."
CENmil_military_science: "Military Science"
CENmil_military_science_desc: "Central America doesn't have many educated scientists, and most of them don't work for the military. While we mostly profit of the technologies developed by our allies, we can't remain dependent forever."
CENmil_economic_warfare: "Economic Warfare"
CENmil_economic_warfare_desc: "A strong army isn't an army with a large manpower poll, an army with a powerful industrial base to back it up, or an army that has access to the most modern and sophisticated equipment and tactics, but an army that can use all of these threes with the backing of the entire nation's economy and production capacities."
CENmil_arms_deals: "Arms Deals"
CENmil_arms_deals_desc: "With our limited military industrial capacities, we will have to import most of our equipment for now. By negotiating good deals and trading with our close allies, our army will enjoy modern equipment at a low price."
 CENmil_equi_developing:0 "Equipment Development"
 CENmil_equi_developing_desc:0 "We can't rely forever on imports, as the political environment of the world may change from one day to another, rending our allies our enemies. We need to become more independent on the development and production of equipment."

## Warfare with Central American Characteristics
CENmil_army_ca: "Central American Doctrine"
CENmil_army_ca_desc: "To the north and the south, the enemies we face are much stronger than we are. Even though it is hard to admit, Sandino and his Syndicalist traitors have nonetheless proven that a smaller force can defeat a much larger enemy when using the terrain and the people's support to your advantage."
CENmil_adapt_terrain: "Adapt to the Terrain"
CENmil_adapt_terrain_desc: "Central America's terrain is very rough and unforgiving, except to those who know it well. Throughout the enemies' offensives, we will be able to harass and destroy them thanks to our knowledge of the terrain."
CENmil_autonomous_officers: "Autonomous Officers"
CENmil_autonomous_officers_desc: "Guerrilla warfare requires swift reactions and decisions taken by those who are in eye sight of the enemy, so we will need to give the officers in the field large autonomy to act independently from high command."
CENmil_small_units: "Small Units"
CENmil_small_units_desc: "Waging war in such difficult terrain requires large flexibility and mobility, which larger units don't have. Squads of a couple of men will be able to outmanoeuvre and outsmart the enemy in the jungles and hills of Central America."
CENmil_improved_conscrip: "Improved Conscription"
CENmil_improved_conscrip_desc: "In order to fight off our enemies, we will need to massively increase the size and manpower of our army. We need to increase our levels of conscription to get as many men as possible into the armed forces."
CENmil_guerrila_tactics: "Guerrilla Tactics"
 CENmil_guerrila_tactics_desc: "In order to be an efficient guerrilla fighter, one needs to know much more than the environment. The art of camouflage and deception can strongly increase the efficiency of our soldiers, and they will also need to know when to engage and when not to."
CENmil_guerilla_spirit: "Guerrilla Spirit"
CENmil_guerilla_spirit_desc: "It takes an iron will to fight successfully as a guerrilla fighter. Many units will have to survive in terrible conditions, while being hunted by the enemies' air force and artillery."
CENmil_large_force: "Large Force"
CENmil_large_force_desc: "In order to rival the forces of our enemies, we need to further expand the size of our army."

# Finisher of Entire Tree

CENmil_military_awesome_desc: "Upon the military rests the entire nation. The army has unified Central America, the army has fought off the enemies of Central America, and the army will keep Central America united. The military doesn't serve the state, but the state serves the military."

### Air and Naval Tree
## Air Tree
CENmil_faca: "The FARCA"
 CENmil_faca_desc: "Formed from the air forces of the nations that are now part of the Republic, the Fuerza Area Republicana de Centroamérica will need a much larger budget and more manpower to effectively fulfil its task of defending Central America's airspace."
CENmil_air_lads: "Air Officers"
 CENmil_air_lads_desc: "As with every branch of the military, the air force is not a newly created branch but the result of the merging of the air forces of the constitute nations of the Union. As such, it has no standardised chain of command or doctrine and needs reform."
CENmil_aa_positions: "AA Positions"
CENmil_aa_positions_desc: "Our air force is by far not large enough to guarantee that our industrial and infrastructural centres are defended from enemy bombers. In order to protect these vital centres, we need more and better anti air batteries."
CENmil_airfield_expansion: "Airfield Expansion"
 CENmil_airfield_expansion_desc: "In order to perform properly, our air force needs new, modernised air bases to operate from."
CENmil_fighters: "FARCA Fighters"
CENmil_fighters_desc: "Our air force is currently mostly operating outdated biplanes. In order to fight the coming air battles, we need to import new, modern designs."
CENmil_cas: "FARCA CAS Aircraft"
CENmil_cas_desc: "Our air force doesn't have a standard close air support aircraft and our best ground supporters are converted fighter biplanes. In order to help our troops, we need to import new, modern designs."
CENmil_bombers: "FARCA Bombers"
CENmil_bombers_desc: "Our air force doesn't possess any heavy aircraft, and as such is unable to perform bombing missions against enemy industrial targets. We need to import new, modern designs."
CENmil_protecc_sky: "Protecting the Sky"
CENmil_protecc_sky_desc: "Thanks to our reforms, our air force is no longer seen as an air farce but as a real fighting force. With the new, modern aircraft and skilled pilots, it will be able to protect the beautiful Central America sky."

# Shared Air/Navy Tree
CENmil_naval_air_coord: "Naval Air Coordination"
 CENmil_naval_air_coord_desc: "Given our country stands in a very narrow isthmus, any potential enemy will try to take advantage of the long shorelines and easy approaches from the air the sea gives. We must seize this opportunity first and deny it to the enemy."
CENmil_nav_bombers: "FARCA Naval Bombers"
 CENmil_nav_bombers_desc: "Undisputed control of both sides of the Panama Canal can be achieved through a superior navy, but that requires enormous investments we can't make. Controlling movement of navies from the skies is a cost-optimal solution."

## Naval Tree
CENmil_fnca: "The ARCA"
 CENmil_fnca_desc: "With our newly formed nation, new needs arise. Previous Central American nations had no need for a large navy, and did little to pursue any sort of naval dominance. With our reunification, we need to reassert ourselves at a regional level, and we can't do so without a navy. As such, we shall found the 'Armada de la Republica de Centroamérica' and begin investing in its development in order to project our power!"
CENmil_select_main_port: "Selecting a Main Naval Base"
CENmil_select_main_port_desc: "Considering the lack of interest in the past in forming functional navies, all of our ports have been built with trade in mind and are not suitable to hold a large surface fleet. We have several ports in our nation that are very promising options to invest in their improvement, but we need to choose which one, as we obviously don't possess the means to upgrade all of our ports."
CENmil_screens: "Screen Ships"
CENmil_screens_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to establish a functional escort fleet, which is capable of defending our trade routes from rogue submarines in case of war. It will also help down the line when we can field larger ships, as the escorts are as vital to a large surface fleet as the very flagship. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to establish a fleet fast will be to acquire foreign screen ships until we can establish dockyards of our own."
CENmil_cruisers: "Cruisers"
CENmil_cruisers_desc: "One of the steps towards establishing a new navy would be to acquire a light cruiser that's able to provide support to our forces in the coastline and deal with enemy destroyers in the sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to field a cruiser will be to acquire a foreign cruiser for now, at least until we can establish dockyards to sustain a fleet on our own."
CENmil_flagship: "Flagship for our Navy"
CENmil_flagship_desc: "With escort ships and the cruiser ready to set sail, we now need a flagship for our young fleet. With a flagship we could finally start projecting our naval power towards the Caribbean and to finally have the means to face a small fleet in the open sea. Since we lack any sort of dockyards in our nation, our best option to obtain a flagship will be to acquire it from a foreign power until we can establish dockyards to build a flagship ourselves."
CENmil_naval_lads: "Naval Officers"
CENmil_naval_lads_desc: "With our new fleet, we have a new demand for officers to occupy the helm of our ships, and new admirals to coordinate our fleet. While some nations were in the progress of making a naval academy, like El Salvador, our best choice will be to send our officers to foreign naval academies in order to get acquainted with the modern basics of naval warfare and fleet manoeuvring."
CENmil_merchant_navy: "Central American Merchant Navy"
CENmil_merchant_navy_desc: "Central America not only needs military ships. Our great nation unfortunately lacks many resources that are plentiful in other places of the world, and we cannot continue our development unless we have a way to bring those resources to us. Provided this, we shall invest in a merchant fleet that will be tasked with keeping the Centroamerican trade alive and prosperous."
CENmil_dual_sea_protecc: "Dual Seas Doctrine"
 CENmil_dual_sea_protecc_desc: "Our nation is one of the few in the world that occupy two separate oceans at the same time, having ports in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, this blessing is also a curse, as we will have to split our efforts in order to cover both oceans at the same time in case of a conflict. Considering we lack the ships in order to win a war by attrition, the defence of our 2 shores takes primacy."

### Events ###
cafla.1.t: "Expédition archéologique sur le site de San Andrés."
cafla.1.d: "L'archéologue américain John Dimmick est arrivé aujourd'hui dans notre pays, et a fait une demande très particulière. Dans la propriété familiale de San Andrés, des visiteurs de la famille Dueñas ont signalé la présence d'anciennes structures partiellement enterrées qui pourraient faire la lumière sur l'histoire des civilisations méso-américaines précolombiennes. Il prétend qu'il financera l'expédition par ses propres moyens et qu'il a besoin que nous leur donnions le feu vert. Root.GetLeader] a déjà annoncé son soutien au projet et a contacté personnellement la famille Dueñas pour demander que l'expédition visite leurs terres. Après une rencontre avec un représentant de la famille Dueñas, Dimmick et[Root.GetLeader], ils ont convenu de donner carte blanche à l'expédition sur le site de fouilles jusqu'à fin mai, avec l'arrivée de la saison des pluies. Espérons que leurs découvertes garderont les archéologues intéressés par notre pays pour les années à venir."
cafla.1.a: "Ils sont les bienvenus pour explorer notre passé."

cafla.2.t: "Le volcan Izalco intensifie son activité strombolienne."
cafla.2.d: "Le volcan Izalco, situé dans le département de Sansonante, au Salvador, a commencé une série d'éruptions irrégulières, brisant le cycle d'une éruption strombolienne par mois à presque une toutes les vingt minutes, avec une quantité croissante de cendres et lave sortant de son intérieur. Alors que l'Izalco n'a cessé d'entrer en éruption depuis sa naissance en 1722, le "Faro del Pacifico" provoque des troubles dans notre population, alors que les craintes d'une violente éruption volcanique commencent à faire surface."
cafla.2.a: "Nous devrons le surveiller."

cafla.3.t: "Le volcan Izalco intensifie encore son activité strombolienne."
 cafla.3.d: "Les rapports de nos géologues indiquent que le volcan Izalco augmente son activité encore plus qu'auparavant. Aujourd'hui, le volcan entre en éruption une fois toutes les huit minutes, et la population civile locale est de plus en plus mal à l'aise face à la situation, car il n'y a aucun plan gouvernemental actuel en cas d'éruption."
cafla.3.a: "Préparer des plans d'évacuation, au cas où..."

cafla.4.t: "Le volcan Izalco revient à un niveau d'activité normal."
 cafla.4.d: "Malgré la panique récente concernant le volcan Izalco, nos géologues rapportent que le volcan a finalement repris ses activités normales, et pendant qu'il a encore des éruptions normales de cendres et de lave vers le secteur sud, les habitants de Sansonante peuvent se reposer tranquillement quand l'activité volcanique commence à se retirer."
cafla.4.a: "Dieu merci, c'est fini."

cafla.5.t: "Inondations à San Salvador"
 cafla.5.d: "En raison des conditions météorologiques récentes et du mauvais entretien du système de drainage de San Salvador, il y a eu une inondation dans la ville salvadorienne. Bien qu'aucun décès n'ait été signalé à la suite de cet incident, les dommages causés à l'infrastructure de la ville sont encore importants et il faudra un certain temps avant que la ville ne soit de nouveau sur pied."
cafla.5.a: "Une tournure malheureuse des événements."

cafla.6.t: "Le volcan Paricutín s'érupte au Michoacán"
cafla.6.d: "Nous avons reçu aujourd'hui de mauvaises nouvelles de la petite ville de Paricutín. L'éruption du volcan Paracutín a commencé dans l'après-midi et la population de la petite ville est maintenant menacée par les pluies de cendres, et nos spécialistes confirment que la coulée de lave va couvrir la ville au rythme actuel des émissions. Le Président [Root.GetLeader] a ordonné l'évacuation immédiate de la ville et les efforts pour les déplacer près d'Uruapan vont commencer. Cela prendra du temps et des efforts, mais c'est une étape nécessaire pour assurer la sécurité de nos citoyens contre une catastrophe naturelle."
cafla.6.a: "Une tournure malheureuse des événements."

cafla.7.t: "Le tremblement de terre frappe le Guatemala !"
cafla.7.d: "A 17h37, un tremblement de terre de 7,7 Richter a commencé près de la côte pacifique guatémaltèque. Le tremblement de terre a causé des dommages considérables à l'infrastructure de la région, faisant tomber les lignes télégraphiques et fracturant la route interaméricaine. La ville de Tecpan a également été gravement endommagée, près de 60 % des logements civils ayant été démolis par le séisme. Le Palacio de los Capitanes Generales à Antigua Guatemala a également été partiellement endommagé, ainsi que de nombreuses églises anciennes de l'époque coloniale dans la région. Malheureusement, trente-huit personnes ont trouvé leur fin dans ce tragique incident, et nous devrons maintenant faire face aux conséquences d'une catastrophe naturelle aussi terrible."
cafla.7.a: "Espérons que ce n'est pas le premier d'une longue série."

cafla.8.t: "Fondation du Musée Régional d'Archéologie de Copan."
cafla.8.d: "Aujourd'hui, le Museo Regional de Arqueologia a finalement été fondé dans la ville de Copán. Le site archéologique de Copán abrite l'un des plus grands complexes architecturaux du début de l'ère préclassique, ainsi que l'une des plus grandes villes de l'ancienne civilisation maya. Le site a été fermé au public en 1935 et a fait l'objet d'une vaste restauration, l'Acropole, la place principale, l'escalier des hiéroglyphes, les temples 11 et 22 ainsi que les 38 Estelas et tous les autels étant au cœur des travaux de restauration. Avec l'inauguration du musée, le site archéologique est à nouveau ouvert au public pour explorer le passé de l'Amérique centrale précolombienne."
cafla.8.a: "Un pas de plus vers la préservation de notre histoire."

cafla.9.t: "Le tremblement de terre frappe le Salvador"
cafla.9.d: "Un fort tremblement de terre a frappé les petites villes de Santa Clara et San Esteban, situées près du volcan San Vicente. Avec une échelle de 6,1 sur l'échelle de Richter, le tremblement de terre a décimé les petites villes, faisant deux cents morts et causant des dégâts considérables dans les deux villes et sur les routes qui les relient. Cependant, le tremblement de terre ne semble pas avoir été causé par le volcan voisin, et les habitants du département de San Vicente peuvent donc pousser un soupir de soulagement car le volcan ne donne aucun signe d'activation dans un avenir proche."
cafla.9.a: "Espérons que notre chance va s'améliorer."

cafla.10.t: "Le tremblement de terre frappe le Salvador"
cafla.10.d: "Un autre tremblement de terre a frappé le Salvador, cette fois dans la municipalité d'Ahuachapán. Le tremblement de terre, d'une magnitude de 5,9 sur l'échelle de Richter, a causé de graves dégâts dans les municipalités d'Ahualchapán et d'Atiquizaya. Heureusement, il n'y a pas eu de morts à cause du tremblement de terre, et bien que les dommages physiques aux deux municipalités soient importants, leur reconstruction ne sera pas une tâche difficile, car elles étaient toutes deux assez sous-développées."
cafla.10.a: "Au moins, tout le monde est en sécurité."

cafla.11.t: "Le tremblement de terre frappe le Salvador"
 cafla.11.d: "Un autre tremblement de terre a frappé le Salvador, cette fois dans la municipalité de Jucuapa. Le tremblement de terre a commencé à 5h02 du matin avec une force de 6,2 sur l'échelle de Richter, et lorsque les services d'urgence étaient déjà mobilisés, un autre tremblement de terre a commencé à 5h06 qui a causé des dégâts encore plus importants que le premier. Le tremblement de terre a causé de graves dégâts dans les départements de La Paz, Usulután et San Miguel et on estime qu'il a fait quatre cents morts, près de mille blessés et plus de vingt mille sans-abri. Le Comité général Ejecutivo Prodamnificados a déjà élaboré des plans pour réinstaller les victimes en El Salvador, mais ce sera une entreprise coûteuse...."
cafla.11.a: "Il semblerait que Mère Nature se soit vengée aujourd'hui..."

cafla.12.t: "Une tempête tropicale frappe les côtes atlantiques du Nicaragua."
cafla.12.d: "Une tempête a frappé notre côte atlantique et elle est actuellement en cours dans la région. Avec des vents forts et une marée dangereuse, les échanges commerciaux dans l'Atlantique ont été suspendus temporairement et beaucoup craignent que la tempête ne s'aggrave dans un avenir proche. Bien que la tempête elle-même ne montre aucun signe d'aggravation, il serait peut-être sage de commencer à préparer les efforts d'évacuation au cas où un ouragan serait en train de se former..."
cafla.12.a: "Nous devons nous préparer au pire."

cafla.13.t: "Un ouragan frappe les côtes atlantiques du Nicaragua."
 cafla.13.d: "Alors que nos plans étaient enfin terminés, le pire s'est produit quand un ouragan s'est formé près de nos côtes et ses vents forts ont commencé à dévaster Puerto Cabezas avant de remonter vers les Caraïbes. Heureusement, nos plans d'évacuation sont entrés en vigueur assez rapidement pour éviter toute perte civile, mais la zone devra être réparée pour pouvoir fonctionner à nouveau."
cafla.13.a: "Nous avons bien choisi et bien préparé."

cafla.14.t: "Un autre ouragan frappe les côtes atlantiques du Nicaragua."
cafla.14.d: "Un ouragan a de nouveau frappé les côtes atlantiques du Nicaragua. La tempête s'est formée presque de nulle part, et la population civile non préparée a souffert de l'imprévisibilité du climat en Amérique centrale. Heureusement, la tempête se dirigeait vers le golfe du Mexique et n'a pas touché le rivage, mais les vents forts ont quand même causé des dégâts sur toute la côte atlantique de l'Amérique centrale."
cafla.14.a: "Nous avons eu de la chance qu'il ne se dirige pas vers nous."

cafla.15.t: "Paricutín menace Santa Ana Zirosto"
cafla.15.d: "Alors que l'éruption du Paracutín continue, une autre ville se trouve sur le chemin de la destruction. La petite ville de Santa Ana Zirosto, fondée à l'époque coloniale, est maintenant sur le chemin des émissions de lave. La ville a reçu l'ordre d'évacuer, et ils se joindront à la population de Paricutín dans les efforts de relocalisation près d'Uruapan."
cafla.15.a: "Nous ne pouvons qu'espérer qu'ils se rétablissent."

cafla.16.t: " Le Paricutín menace San Juan Parangaricutiro ."
 cafla.16.d: "Alors que nos spécialistes nous assurent que l'éruption du Paricutín touche à sa fin, la ville de San Juan Parangaricutiro, avec près de deux mille habitants, est maintenant sur le chemin de la lave. Heureusement, le major préparait déjà un plan de secours au cas où le volcan menacerait la ville, mais notre aide serait toujours appréciée. La ville et ses habitants seront relocalisés dans l'ancienne ferme Conejos Farmstead, à près de trente kilomètres de l'emplacement d'origine de la ville. Le président [Root.GetLeader] a félicité le major pour sa clairvoyance, et les efforts de relocalisation sont déjà en route."
cafla.16.a: "Espérons que ça se termine bientôt."

cafla.17.t: "Paricutín s'arrête enfin de faire l'éruption"
cafla.17.d: "Le volcan Paricutín a finalement cessé d'émettre de la lave, et bien que le volcan puisse encore être une menace pour les populations voisines pour les années à venir, nous avons évité une catastrophe majeure en évacuant notre population civile et alors que les nuages de cendres peuvent encore affecter nos terres agricoles et nos villes voisines. Les villes qui ont été inhumées seront constituées en mémoriaux pour les anciens habitants, et seront considérées comme faisant partie intégrante de leur administration malgré leur relocalisation afin qu'ils puissent faire de leurs villes d'antan ce qu'ils veulent."
cafla.17.a: " Et voilà, c'est finalement terminé."

cafla.20.d: "L'archéologue et ethnographe américaine Doris Zemurray Stone a publié son livre compilant les découvertes de divers archéologues concernant plusieurs sites archéologiques d'Amérique centrale au Honduras. L'une des plus belles œuvres de recherche archéologique de la région, son livre se concentre principalement sur les notes concernant la Playa de los Muertos de George Clapp Vaillant et Dorothy Popenoe et comment elles façonnent la nouvelle image des cultures méso-américaines. Le livre est rapidement devenu un incontournable pour tout passionné d'histoire méso-américaine précolombienne, et a propulsé le prestige du jeune directeur du Musée national du Costa Rica vers de nouveaux sommets."
