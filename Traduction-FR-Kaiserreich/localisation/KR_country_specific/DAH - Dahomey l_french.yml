### Events ###
dah.001.t: "Expertise française"
 #Oh Great Frenchie of The Lake, what is your wisdom?:
 dah.001.d: "The French hold much knowledge of state building, even in their exiled state. Perhaps we should ask them to share some of this knowledge, so that we may become a stronger ally?"
 dah.001.a: "Seek aid in agricultural development"
 dah.001.b: "Ask for their expertise in construction and engineering."
 dah.001.c: "Could you please show us how to build all of your fancy weapons?"

 dah.002.t: "Armes étrangères"
 dah.002.d: "Our military is young, and lacks much of the basic equipment that an army needs, guns especially. One way we could make up for this deficiency is to ask one of the major powers (except those blasted Germans) to sell us some guns. Should we go ahead with this?"
 dah.002.a: "Faisons le tour."

 dah.005.t: "Our Place In The Wider World"
 dah.005.d: "Before the days of African colonisation, we were a free and self-sufficient people. No one could keep us from being strong, proud, and free. Nowadays though, the world is a much bigger place, with many actors far larger than us. We are thus forced to consider our place in the world. Will we become a subject of France once more? Or perhaps we should go free, and take our chances there? Or do we sit back and allow events to develop before making this choice?"
 dah.005.a: "Time will tell. Sooner or later, time will tell."

 dah.006.t: "Dahomey wants to purchase Guns"
 dah.006.d: "The recently independent nation of Dahomey wants to purchase firearms from us to supply their nascent military. How shall we respond?"
 dah.006.a: "We can certainly sell some to them!"
 dah.006.b: "We need the equipment for ourselves"
 dah.006.c: "Let us sell a few of them"

 dah.007.t: " Réponse à la vente d'armes à feu "
 dah.007.d: "We have received word from [DAH_gun_target.GetNameDef] about the guns we want to purchase!"
 dah.007.a: "They will sell them to us!"
 dah.007.b: "Curses, they turned us down!"
