KTG_Invite_Foreign_Advisors_desc: "While many would now seek to expel foreign threats to our way of life, this cannot be.

KTG_Hire_Askaris: "Hire Askaris"

KTG_Memory_Of_Msiri_desc: "The great Msiri held of the Europeans for many years and brought the Yeke kingdom to the zenith of its power. Information gathering was essential to his success, and if our forces are to secure victory in the field, they must be trained in reconnaissance."

KTG_Establish_Relations_With_Portugal: "Lumumbashi-Kamoto Railway"
KTG_Establish_Relations_With_Portugal_desc: "While we might reject the European notions of progress, there is no denying that railways are an almost vital means of transporting goods.

KTG_Dominer_Pour_Servir: "Dominer pour Servir"
KTG_Dominer_Pour_Servir_desc: "'Rule so we can Serve'. These simple words define the colonial policy that the old Belgian government decreed in the Congo.

KTG_Restoration_Missions: "Restoration of the Missions"
 KTG_Restoration_Missions_desc: "En raison des politiques allemandes agressives contre le pouvoir de l'église catholique, beaucoup de nos postes de mission ont été abandonnés.

KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap: "Abolish the Invisible Colour Gap"
KTG_Abolish_Invisible_Colour_Gap_desc: "While unlike the British or French colonies there never was a distinct colour gap in Congo, a glass ceiling blocked the Congolese from reaching high administrative or political positions.

KTG_Educate_Native_Engineers: "Educate Native Engineers"
KTG_Educate_Native_Engineers_desc: "German reforms in the last decades have greatly changed the consciousness of the Katangese population.

 KTG_Centre_Extra_Coutumiers_desc: "While the system of Chefferies worked well in the past, the growing population and the questionable loyalty of the chefs has pushed the government to create their own economic centres on the countryside.

KTG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies: "Monopolise Agricultural Companies"
 KTG_Monopolise_Agricultural_Companies_desc: "Currently our agricultural industry constitutes of farming quotas emplaced on the villages and the collection of these whenever the district manager passes by the village.

KTG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life: "Control all Aspects of Modern Life"
KTG_Control_All_Aspects_of_Modern_Life_desc: "The UMHK controls all aspects of its workers lives. They work in its mines, eat in its cantinas, buy their groceries in its stores.

 KTG_Embrace_Congolese_Belgian_Culture_desc: "Ludwigsstadt est devenue une plaque tournante pour les Flamands-Wallons et les Katangais qui vivent les uns à côté des autres.

 KTG_Stability_Force_Publique_desc: "En raison du chaos qui a suivi la rébellion de Mwamis, les Flamands-Walloons de Ludwigsstadt ont rapidement reformé la Force Publique à partir des cendres des askaris allemands pour résister à son attaque.

ktg.1.t: "Katanga offers a Non-aggression Pact"
ktg.1.d: "Along with our independence, the people of Katanga have also secured their part of the Congo. Now they have sent an envoy to our capital to discuss terms of peaceful coexistence. They guarantee no aid to our enemies, the Kivu, in exchange for a non-aggression pact securing their independence after the war is over and free access to the old Colonial port of Boma."
ktg.1.a: "Accept their treaty."
ktg.1.b: "Refuse their proposal."

ktg.2.t: "Kongo accepts Non-aggression Pact"
ktg.2.d: "The government of Kongo has agreed with our proposal and has signed a non-aggression pact with ours. If we are to continue using our access to the sea via the Boma route, we can't interfere in any way in the Congolese wars."
ktg.2.a: "To a peaceful cooperation!"

ktg.3.t: "Kongo refuses Non-aggression Pact"
ktg.3.d: "The Kongolese have refused our offer and have wilfully avoided answering our question of guaranteed independence. This means that war with the Kongo after their fight with the Kivu is almost guaranteed. To avoid defeat against a numerically superior enemy we best look for other allies, like the Germans..."
ktg.3.a: "This will lead nowhere."

#Belgian-German recolonisation effort

ktg.20.t: "The Mwami Has Seized Control!"
 ktg.20.d: "Alors que les collecteurs d'impôts rentrent des territoires de l'intérieur et que les mineurs de l'Union Minière profitent d'un dimanche après-midi paisible bien mérité, la nouvelle arrive dans la capitale que le Mwami du peuple Garanganze a déposé le gouverneur allemand, exécuté ses associés et pris le contrôle de la province.\n\nLa majorité de la population n'est toujours pas au courant de ces événements choquants et entretient des relations relativement sereines avec l'administration flamande et wallonne, ce qui constitue un choc énorme pour les coloniaux. Pendant plus de 50 ans, la parole de l'homme blanc faisait loi et toute forme de désobéissance était sévèrement punie. Maintenant, un roi indigène d'un petit village a osé se dresser contre leurs ordres et a pris le pouvoir en main.\n\nUne compétition de football amicale entre les Flamands-Walloons et les Katangais vient de commencer lorsque la nouvelle tombe dans la ville de Ludwigsstadt. Dans un premier temps, les citoyens n'arrivent pas à croire ce qu'ils entendent et la vie continue comme si de rien n'était. Dans le quartier général colonial, le chaos a éclaté avec une division entre ceux qui veulent rester et se battre pour préserver ce qu'ils ont construit pendant des années et ceux qui veulent quitter le continent aussi vite que possible. L'évêque de la ville peut être vu en train de parler avec le chef des forces Askari stationnées dans la ville et Pierre Ryckmans, le maire de la ville. Doivent-ils tenter de fuir le pays maintenant que la domination allemande a vacillé ou doivent-ils se retrancher dans le quartier blanc protégé par les loyales forces Askari ?"
ktg.20.a: "Order a mass evacuation of the colony!"
 ktg.20.b: "L'administration flamande-wallonne reste en place."
 ktg.20.c: "L'administration flamande-wallonne tente de rester sur place."

 ktg.2001.t: "Alone on the Dark Continent"
 ktg.2001.d: "Bien que Ryckmans ait donné l'ordre de se retrancher dans la ville de Ludwigsstadt, la population katangaise à l'intérieur n'était pas dupe ; elle avait vu l'administration Mittelafrikaine dépouiller l'administration flamande-wallonne de son pouvoir, elle avait vu beaucoup d'entre eux être exportés, leur bush fermé et leurs armes calibrées. Les forces du Mwami gagneront ce combat à coup sûr, alors là, ils savaient qu'il ne servait à rien de résister."
 ktg.2001.a: "This is only going to end one way."

ktg.21.t: "Alone on the Dark Continent"
 ktg.21.d: "Lorsque Ryckmans donne l'ordre de se retrancher dans la ville de Ludwigsstadt, la population katangaise réalise enfin ce qui se passe. Alors qu'une certaine partie de la population considère la rébellion et la chute de la domination allemande comme leur chance de se libérer de la domination européenne, la majorité de la population de la ville est moins convaincue par les arguments de leurs frères. Bien que leur vie dans la ville n'ait pas été facile, beaucoup se souviennent des jours de leur passé tribal et des difficultés qu'ils ont apportées avec eux. La domination européenne a peut-être été féroce et souvent injuste, mais elle a apporté un certain degré de bien-être que beaucoup ne veulent plus abandonner et se sont donc ralliés à la bannière de l'administration coloniale.\n\nDes tables, des chaises, des armoires et d'autres meubles sont traînés dans les rues pour établir des barricades temporaires tandis que les citoyens des banlieues sont transférés sur la place de la ville. Des armes et des fournitures médicales, dont beaucoup datent de l'époque belge, sont retirées des kazernes et des lits sont transportés à l'hôpital de Ludwigsstadt. Alors que beaucoup d'hommes, de femmes et d'enfants n'ont aucune expérience du combat, des centaines de jeunes mineurs, d'ouvriers d'usine et d'employés coloniaux sont contraints de prendre les armes pour défendre leurs familles et leur ville contre l'armée des Mwamis. Sur une population totale d'environ 45 000 citoyens, 35 000 se sont barricadés avec les forces flamandes et wallonnes, tandis que le reste a fui la ville et s'est réfugié dans les villages voisins. Seules de petites bandes de séparatistes restent maintenant à l'extérieur du centre fortifié et pillent et saccagent la périphérie de la ville, se vengeant sur les évolués et les propriétés des Blancs en vue de l'arrivée des forces Mwamis."
ktg.21.a: "A soft rain is setting in."

ktg.22.t: "Mwami Forces Approach the City"
 ktg.22.d: "Trois jours se sont écoulés depuis l'assassinat du gouverneur et l'effondrement du régime allemand et les forces du Mwami marchent sur Ludwigsstadt pour détruire une fois pour toutes tout ce qui reste du régime colonial. De nombreux villages situés sur la route de Ludwigsstadt ont déjà choisi leur camp et ont soit juré fidélité, soit été mis à sac par ses forces. Village après village, le Mwami s'approche de la capitale, les Blancs de tous les villages environnants et les ouvriers des compagnies flamandes et wallonnes se sont rendus dans la ville pour se réfugier derrière sa barricade. Des nouvelles de la résistance ont été envoyées en Flandre-Wallonie pour les informer de la marche du Mwami, mais avec des infrastructures en ruines après l'effondrement et des groupes de vagabonds parcourant le bassin du Congo, il est devenu évident qu'aucune aide européenne n'arrivera à temps."
ktg.22.a: "Finalise all preparations."

ktg.23.t: "The Siege Begins"
 ktg.23.d: "On the evening of the first week, the Mwami has finally reached the city. With rain still pouring down as if God himself has opened the flood gates, life inside the fortifications is becoming tougher with the day.\n\nUnder cover of darkness a perimeter is established surrounding the city by the Mwami while scouting parties are sent inside the outskirts to investigate the fortifications made by the Colonials. While the Mwami is outnumbered by the population of Ludwigsstadt, his army consists of trained warriors and disgruntled veterans from the East-Afrika offensive while the defenders only have a small 1000 soldiers armed with Weltkrieg weapons from the Force Publique and a couple of European officers. To frighten the defenders, the Mwami has commanded a thousand fires to be lit around the city and has initiated a war chant dating back from the Lunda war, to show the colonials that the Stairs Expedition will be avenged with fire and blood."
ktg.23.a: "Tighten the perimeter!"

ktg.24.t: "Battle for Ludwigsstadt"
ktg.24.d: "At 8.00 the Mwami finally gives the signal citizens of Ludwigsstadt have anxiously awaited during the night. Horns are sounded, shouting intensifies and the first charge commences. The assaulting force, numbering over 5000 trained warriors from his capital in Bunkeya, storm through the main avenue while deserted Askari warriors cover their attack."
ktg.24.a: "Fix bayonets! Repel them at all cost!"

ktg.25.t: "The Mwami Falls Back"
ktg.25.d: "For over 12 hours now, the battle for Ludwigsstadt has been raging with heavy casualties on both sides forcing both parties to fall back for now and cut their losses. While the blockade at the north side of Kamalondo got overrun just after the morning, a concentrated effort of German machine guns, ex-soldiers of the Force Publique and an armed citizen militia was able to reconquer the point just before the evening, thus preventing a major breakthrough in the neighbourhood. While much of the Southern suburbs got overrun in the assault, with parts of the city set ablaze to cover the retreat, the fight did not provide the Mwami the decisive victory he desired and needed for the morale of his soldiers. Even though casualties are hard to estimate with certain parts of the city still in active combat, Ryckmans has estimated casualties on his side to number upwards of 3000. Casualties in the loyal Askari force were quite minimal but the loss of squads in the reconquest of Kamalondo are taking their toll on the already limited force."
ktg.25.a: "The future is looking bleak."

ktg.26.t: "The Assault Recommences"
ktg.26.d: "Throughout the rest of the week, the Mwami furiously resumed his attacks on the city, each subsequent attack proving less effective than the last. Seeing the resolve of the Lubumbashi populace and the firm leadership by the Colonial administration, desertion has started to spread through the ranks of the Mwamin causing severe issues to his supply lines and the morale of the remaining warriors. At last the Mwami, sees no other solution than to offer a ceasefire to Pierre Ryckmans. Upon agreement, he offers the Colonials the right to retain their autonomy and power over the city of Ludwigsstadt, control over the mines of the UMHK and a continuation of the pre-Collapse policy as long as he is allowed to rule the Yeke kingdom from his seat in Bunkeya as he pleases."
ktg.26.a: "Accept the Ceasefire."

ktg.27.t: "End of the Siege"
ktg.27.d: "With the last of the Mwamis forces leaving the city, the devastation caused by the siege has finally become apparent. Hundreds of houses are burned down, streets are blockaded by debris and thousands of brave Congolese and colonials lay unburied on the battlefield. This fight may be won but the recovery has only just begun."
ktg.27.a: "Colonial order is restored!"

ktg.29.t: "Appointment of the New Colonial Governor"
ktg.29.d: "After the passing of the previous governor in the chaos of the Mittel-Afrikan collapse, a new governor has to be appointed to rule over the Katanga province. While the Mwami will remain as the official ruler, he will only be used as a titular chieftain while the real power is held by the Colonial office and the UMHK. Due to his steadfast leadership and dedication in the siege, Pierre Ryckmans has unanimously been elected by the Colonial administration until further elections can be held. Although Ryckmans has showed contrary to many of his predecessors that he cares about the native population, the Katangese citizens are worried that a continuation of the old Belgian colonial policy is on hands."
ktg.29.b: "Good Luck Pierre Ryckmans!"

ktg.28.t: "Riots of Ludwigsstadt"
ktg.28.d: "With the Mwami approaching the city, many of the formerly loyal inhabitants see their chance at true independence free from White oppression. Mass rioting breaks out with houses of colonials being plundered and set ablaze. Greek and Italian restaurants and shops are being set alight and the overseers at UMHK decapitated on the streets."
ktg.28.a: "Katanga will be independent!"

### European Policy ###

#Germany
ktg.30.t: "Envoy from the Garanganze"
ktg.30.d: "An envoy from Ludwigsstadt, deep in the jungles of the Congo has arrived in our capital of Windhuk. They report that a small division of the Force Publique and the remaining colonials were able to hold off the armies of the Mwami. A treaty was thus signed between the citizens of Ludwigsstadt and the Mwami, allowing them to continue their colonial rule with the Mwami as symbolic leader. Even though their situation is stable at the moment, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has requested further support to assure Reichspakt influence over the province."
ktg.30.a: "Support their government."
ktg.30.b: "Refuse all aid."

ktg.31.t: "Treaty with the Südwestafrika"
ktg.31.d: "Our envoys have returned from Windhuk bringing with them support from the German colony. While they have reluctantly recognised our sovereignty for now, it's clear that once they have become more powerful, a formal request to rejoin Mittel-Afrika will be made."
ktg.31.a: "Consolidate our power."

ktg.32.t: "The Namibians have Abandoned Us!"
 ktg.32.d: "Our envoys have returned empty handed from the German colony of Südwestafrika, bringing word that they have no intention of backing our government."
 ktg.32.a: "Damn it."

ktg.33.t: "Envoy from the Garanganze"
 ktg.33.d: "An envoy from Ludwigsstadt, deep in the jungles of the Congo has arrived in our capital of Dar-es-Salaam. They report that a small division of the Force Publique and the remaining colonials were able to hold off the armies of the Mwami. A treaty was thus signed between the citizens of Ludwigsstadt and the Mwami, allowing them to continue their colonial rule with the Mwami as symbolic leader. Even though their situation is stable at the moment, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has requested further support to assure Reichspakt influence over the province."
ktg.33.a: "Support their government."
ktg.33.b: "Refuse all aid."

 ktg.34.t: "Treaty with the East Africa"
 ktg.34.d: "Our envoys have returned from Dar-es-Salaam bringing with them support from the German colony. While they have reluctantly recognised our sovereignty for now, it's clear that once they have become more powerful, a formal request to rejoin their nation will be made."
ktg.34.a: "Consolidate our power."

 ktg.35.t: "Daressalam has Abandoned Us!"
 ktg.35.d: "Our envoys have returned empty-handed from the German colony of East Africa, bringing word that they have no intention of backing our government. Without support from Daressalam, it'll be very hard for the Colonial government to hold on to power with enemies on all sides."
ktg.35.a: "We'll have to hold on with what we have."

#Flanders-Wallonia
ktg.40.t: "Envoy from Katanga"
 ktg.40.d: "Grâce à un vaste réseau de communication soutenu par l'église catholique du Katanga, des nouvelles nous sont parvenues sur la situation de notre ancienne colonie. Grâce à une utilisation intelligente de la Force Publique et à l'utilisation de la population de Ludwigsstadt, le gouvernement colonial de Pierre Ryckmans a pu rétablir la domination coloniale. Maintenant, une demande officielle a été faite par son gouvernement pour le soutien de notre pays. Dans le chaos qui a suivi la chute de Mittel-Afrika, la plupart de nos citoyens vivant et travaillant au Congo ont pu s'échapper vers Ludwigsstadt où se trouve le pouvoir central de nos opérations minières. Les rapports des missions indiquent qu'environ 10.000 de nos coloniaux ont pu se retirer à Ludwigsstadt où ils ont proclamé Pierre Ryckmans comme leur gouverneur colonial. Bien que notre gouvernement ne soit pas en mesure de lancer une offensive à grande échelle pour libérer nos citoyens, les coloniaux ont demandé que nous leur envoyions des armes, des munitions et des vivres afin qu'ils puissent résister aux chefs de guerre africains."
ktg.40.a: "Send them all the help we can give them."
ktg.40.b: "Wait for the German response."

ktg.41.t: "Support from the motherland"
 ktg.41.d: "Grâce à un réseau complexe d'accords louches et à l'utilisation des nations environnantes, le soutien de la Flandre-Wallonie est arrivé à Ludwigsstadt. Ils ont apporté des équipements indispensables pour combler nos pénuries, des outils et des experts de Flandre-Wallonie ont également été transportés pour aider à la reconstruction de la ville. D'autres aides ont été promises par Bruxelles mais sont en attente d'approbation dans le port d'Anvers."
ktg.41.a: "Let's get to work!"

ktg.42.t: "The motherland hesitates"
 ktg.42.d: "Bien qu'il existe une pression politique certaine au sein du gouvernement pour soutenir les citoyens flamands et wallons (et surtout les mines), ils ont décidé d'attendre une réponse allemande avant de s'engager pleinement dans notre cause."
ktg.42.a: "Hopefully aid will arrive in time."

 ktg.43.t: "Garanganze a demandé une aide flamande et wallonne."
 ktg.43.d: "Nous avons appris que le gouvernement colonial du Katanga, dirigé par Pierre Ryckmans, a demandé l'aide des Flamands pour la reconstruction de la capitale et le soutien de l'armée. Avec environ 10.000 Flamands-Wallons dans la colonie, le gouvernement n'a pas d'autre choix que de soutenir ses compatriotes. Pour l'instant, ils doivent cependant attendre la réponse allemande. Cela pourrait être notre chance de gagner leur soutien dans nos efforts de recolonisation si nous offrons nos ports et nos infrastructures à leur mission."
 ktg.43.a: "Offrir de l'aide aux Flamands-Wallons."
ktg.43.b: "Refuse to recognise their state."

ktg.44.t: "Südwestafrika offers support"
ktg.44.d: "The German colony of Südwestafrika has offered to help us in our relief mission to the trapped colonials by opening up their ports and railroads to our shipments. While we are grateful for their aid, it seems like they will use this to later on force a deal out of us."
ktg.44.a: "We have no choice but to accept."

ktg.45.t: "Further requests from Ludwigsstadt"
ktg.45.d: "While our previous shipments have (mostly) safely arrived in Ludwigsstadt, the colonial government has requested us to sent military personnel as well to help in training and expanding the Force Publique. Veterans from the East-Afrika offensive who have returned to Flanders-Wallonia after the Weltkrieg are volunteering to help their countrymen and are asking the government permission to lead an expedition into the Congo."
ktg.45.a: "Approve their expedition."
ktg.45.b: "Only send equipment."

ktg.46.t: "Expedition from Flanders-Wallonia"
ktg.46.d: "To further complement our regiments of the Force Publique, Flanders-Wallonia has decided to sent an armed expedition led by veterans from the East-Afrika offensive. Under the command of Charles Tombeur and Armand Huyghé, the trained veterans have been placed in the barracks of Ludwigsstadt to help fortify the city."
ktg.46.a: "The Force Publique stands stronger!"

ktg.47.t: "Flanders-Wallonia sends more equipment"
ktg.47.d: "While we had requested a military expedition from the motherland, it seems that Brussel has decided to limit their intervention to just equipment and supplies."
ktg.47.a: "We can't complain, weapons are weapons."

#Portugal
ktg.50.t: "Trade mission from Katanga"
ktg.50.d: "After the collapse of Mittel-Afrika, the remaining colonial rule was heavily challenged by the Garanganze Mwami until he was finally defeated in Ludwigsstadt and reduced to a titular king. Due to our ambitions to take over the region and our access to the ports of the Atlantic Ocean, the colonial government under Pierre Ryckmans has offered us a trade agreement where we would allow them to use our ports and railroads in exchange for heavy tariffs. While this could be a profitable agreement, we have to keep our expansion plans in mind. Supporting a Reichspakt colony could drastically reduce our chances of conquest."
ktg.50.a: "Allow free trade."
ktg.50.b: "Refuse them access to our ports."

ktg.51.t: "Trade agreement signed"
ktg.51.d: "The Portuguese government has accepted our proposal and has opened up the ports of Angola to trade."
ktg.51.a: "Finally the mines can return to max capacity."

ktg.52.t: "Trade agreement refused"
ktg.52.d: "The Portuguese have refused our proposal and closes off all Angolese ports to our traders. Without their access, the only way to export our resources is through bribing war-chiefs and shady deals."
ktg.52.a: "Contact the war-chiefs."

ktg.53.t: "Portuguese express interest in our territories"
ktg.53.d: "The Portuguese government has made its intentions to conquer our territory clear and is starting to prepare an invasion. While our forces couldn't possibly hold off the entire Portuguese army, digging ourselves in until German intervention appears may secure our continued existence. On the other hand, we could offer the province to Portugal sparing our citizens and industry the brunt of their invasion."
ktg.53.a: "Dig ourselves in."
ktg.53.b: "Propose a peaceful resolution."

ktg.54.t: "Katanga proposes a deal"
ktg.54.d: "Wary of our expansion drift, the government of Ludwigsstadt has offered a peaceful resolution to the conflict. They offer to transfer control over to our government if we can guarantee their mining operations and European population. While their offer could prevent needless loss of Portuguese lives, it will force us to adhere to their colonial structure instead of full annexation into our African holdings."
ktg.54.a: "Accept their offer."
ktg.54.b: "Refuse their offer and continue preparations."

ktg.55.t: "The Portuguese have refused our offer"
ktg.55.d: "Our diplomats have returned empty handed as the Portuguese government expressed their desire for full integration into their empire. With no possible peaceful resolution to the conflict, we can only hope that our European allies can interfere in time."
ktg.55.a: "Prepare the defences."

ktg.56.t: "The Portuguese have accepted our offer"
ktg.56.d: "The Portuguese government has accepted our offer and have sent with our diplomats Portuguese citizens who are to help us in the transfer of power. The Portuguese flag has been hoisted in Ludwigsstadt and the Mwami has been crowned king of Portuguese Garanganze."
ktg.56.a: "A change of government is in order."

ktg.57.t: "Katanga prepares its defences"
ktg.57.d: "Fearing a full scale invasion into their territory, the Garanganze are fortifying their capital of Ludwigsstadt and enlisting as many foreign aid as possible. While they still won't be able to stand up to our army, they are going to hold out as long as they can."
ktg.57.a: "Continue preparations."

ktg.58.t: "Katanga request assistance"
ktg.58.d: "Fearing a Portuguese invasion, the Garanganze have contacted us to discuss a possible alliance to ward off Portuguese ambitions. They offer to reattach themselves to our colony if we help them in their struggle against the Portuguese."
ktg.58.a: "Integrate Katanga."
ktg.58.b: "Refuse their offer."

ktg.59.t: "Südwestafrika offer aid in exchange for reattachment"
ktg.59.d: "The German colonies have answered our call for aid and Südwestafrika has promised us aid if we join their recreation of Mittel-Afrika project. Without any other way to survive the Portuguese invasion, we have no choice but to accept these harsh demands."
ktg.59.a: "Transfer power to Windhuk."

ktg.591.t: "Südwestafrika refuses to intervene"
ktg.591.d: "To avoid direct confrontation with Portugal, the German government in Windhuk has refused to sent help and has left us all on our own. It shall be a hard fight but with some luck, we may be able to survive behind our fortifications."
ktg.591.a: "Defiance till the end!"

#Resource Leasing

 ktg.60.d: "Pour augmenter encore leurs profits, des sociétés minières et de ressources flamandes et wallonnes basées au Katanga ont proposé de s'intéresser à certaines de nos plantations et forêts. En échange de la vente de certaines de ces forêts, elles proposent de développer la région en stimulant notre propre production de caoutchouc et en modernisant nos chemins de fer."
ktg.60.a: "Sell the Forests."
ktg.60.b: "Refuse their offer."

ktg.61.t: "Rubber Forests Acquired"
ktg.61.d: "After successfully lobbying and convincing their government, the UMHK and its subsidiaries have successfully bought Rubber forests in Bas-Congo."
ktg.61.a: "Splendid."

ktg.62.t: "Offer denied"
ktg.62.d: "Even though we offered profitable terms for their government, the sale of large scale Rubber plantations has been refused, sending our investors packing."
ktg.62.a: "Truly a shame."

ktg.63.t: "Katanga offers interest in our Diamond reserves"
 ktg.63.d: "Pour augmenter encore leurs profits, des sociétés minières et de ressources flamandes et wallonnes basées au Katanga ont proposé de s'intéresser à certaines de nos mines de diamants. En échange de la vente de certaines de ces mines, elles proposent de développer la région en stimulant notre propre industrie et en modernisant nos chemins de fer."

ktg.64.a: "Splendid."

ktg.65.t: "Offer denied"
ktg.65.d: "Even though we offered profitable terms for their government, the sale of large diamond mines has been refused, sending our investors packing."
ktg.65.a: "Truly a shame."

#Elections Ludwigsstadt
ktg.70.t: "Elections in Ludwigsstadt"
ktg.70.d: "For the first time in colonial history free elections to both black and whites will decide on the new mayor (and de facto governor) of Katanga. The Catholic missions have proposed that Pierre Ryckmans continues his term while the large companies (like the UMHK) urge the voters to choose Jules Cousin as leader of the city. A new African workers party, under the lead of Léonard Mpoyi, has also announced their bid for the position and has been seen swaying voters in the cité indigène."
ktg.70.a: "Pierre Ryckmans and the Catholics."
ktg.70.b: "Jules Cousin and the UMHK."
ktg.70.c: "Léonard Mpoyi and the African Workers Party."

#Ryckmans vs Mwami
ktg.71.t: "Ryckmans consolidates Colonial power"
 ktg.71.d: "Après la victoire sur le Mwami, le gouvernement colonial rétabli sous la direction de Pierre Ryckmans a poursuivi son chemin pour consolider son pouvoir. Alors que le Mwami panse ses plaies à Bunkeya et avec le soutien de la population de Ludwigsstadt, une lettre officielle est envoyée au Mwami pour l'informer que ses services ne sont plus nécessaires au Katanga et qu'il est écarté du pouvoir. Cela ne manquera pas de perturber ses plus fidèles partisans, mais après leur défaite, des frappes précises et minutieuses de la Force Publique et des parachutistes flamands et wallons éteindront, espérons-le, leur flamme de résistance."
ktg.71.a: "Ryckmans assumes full control over Katanga."

ktg.72.t: "The Mwami refuses"
 ktg.72.d: "Word has returned from Bunkeya where the Mwami, outraged by our demands, has ripped the letter apart and given the order to remobilise his forces. Due to their loss in Ludwigsstadt earlier this year, his troops are under supplied and lacking in ammunition. Meanwhile the Force Publique has been preparing their assault unit and para-commandos from Flanders-Wallonia have landed in Ludwigsstadt earlier today."
ktg.72.a: "Assault Bunkeya!"

ktg.73.t: "The Mwami has fled!"
 ktg.73.d: "Realising that his position in Bunkeya is unattainable, he has given the order to retreat to the old fortress of Munema where they will entrench themselves and wait for our forces to arrive. Meanwhile the first trucks loaded with our troops have arrived in Bunkeya and the city has been secured. A temporary airstrip has been created to accommodate the para-commandos, while a new plan of action is being formalised."
ktg.73.a: "Offer the Mwami a last chance to surrender."

ktg.74.t: "Final assault on Munema"
 ktg.74.d: "Honorant son héritage, le Mwami a décidé de mourir en combattant les coloniaux comme son ancêtre Msiri l'avait fait lors de l'expédition Stairs. En réponse à sa décision et mal à l'aise avec la perte de vies de la Force Publique, Tombeur a donné l'ordre de bombarder la forteresse de Munema et de poursuivre avec une poussée combinée des para-commandos flamands et wallons et des fantassins de la Force Publique. L'ancienne forteresse n'était pas du tout capable de résister à ce type de guerre moderne et est tombée en moins de deux heures, le Mwami menant une charge désespérée contre les para-commandos lorsqu'il a finalement été fauché par les tirs combinés. Après que la poussière soit retombée et que les blessés aient été transportés pour être soignés, le nombre final de morts s'élevait à 24 troupes coloniales contre près de 1 000 des meilleurs Mwamis."
ktg.74.a: "So falls the house of Msiri."

#Flavour
ktgfla.1.t: "Football in Katanga"
ktgfla.1.d: "Due to Belgian influence and Catholic missionaries from West-Flanders, football is slowly becoming the most important religion in Katanga. Organised by père Raphaël de la Kethulle football matches and small championships are held throughout Ludwigsstadt. Through growing mining cites and the continued education policy of our governor, the père hopes to improve social promotion of the Africans and has requested the government to further expand his vision by the creation of the Association Sportive Congolaise."
ktgfla.1.a: "Approve the organisation."

 ktgfla.2.t: "Reconnaissance de l'Association de football de Flandre-Wallonie"
 ktgfla.2.d: "La FWFA a observé avec enthousiasme la popularité croissante du football au Katanga et a décidé d'injecter des fonds supplémentaires dans l'Association Sportive Congolaise, en améliorant son infrastructure, en lui fournissant un meilleur soutien et en lui permettant même de se qualifier pour la coupe de Flandre-Wallonie. Pour renforcer encore les liens entre les deux organisations, le club de Beerschot a annoncé sa visite à Ludwigsstadt pour affronter les meilleurs de notre nation. Pour montrer le succès du retour du régime colonial, les plans d'une nouvelle gare sont en cours d'élaboration et portent le nom d'Adelbert Ier."
ktgfla.2.a: "Show them that Katanga has entered the 20th century!"

 ktgfla.3.t: "King Adelbert Stadium"
 ktgfla.3.d: "Construit sous la supervision attentive du père de la Kethulle et financé par l'Association Sportive Congolaise, des centaines d'ouvriers ont travaillé pendant des mois pour terminer le projet de prestige du gouvernement colonial. Grâce au père de la Kethulle, des centaines d'écoliers katangais se sont portés volontaires pour aider à la construction, dans l'espoir de pouvoir un jour devenir champion du monde et jouer dans la ligue flamande-wallonaise. Construit pour plus de 50 000 supporters, le stade est censé devenir le centre des associations sportives de Ludwigsstadt, un club d'athlétisme étant également prévu."
ktgfla.3.a: "Slowly the building grows."

ktgfla.4.t: "Ludwigsstadt-Beerschot"
 ktgfla.4.d: "Le grand jour est enfin arrivé, Beerschot s'est envolé de Bruxelles pour Ludwigsstadt afin de jouer contre le club de Ludwigsstadt qui a réussi à battre Bunkeya dans un match serré 4-3 le mois dernier. Accompagné par une musique forte et même une performance de l'orchestre de la Force Publique, le stade a commencé à se remplir avec plus de 50.000 Katangais déjà à l'intérieur et plus de 20.000 attendant à l'extérieur. Avec un soleil brûlant qui éclaire les supporters, le match a commencé par un but de Mokuna contre le gardien flamand-wallon. Les attaquants de Beerschot ont réussi à renverser la vapeur à la 42e minute en marquant deux buts contre la défense défaillante de Ludwigsstadt, plaçant le score à 2-1 à la mi-temps. Au cours de la deuxième mi-temps, trois autres attaques de Beerschot ont été bloquées par la défense de Ludwigsstadt et Mokuna a pu marquer un autre but à la 76e minute, portant le score final à 2-2. Enthousiasmés par la belle performance que leur équipe a pu offrir aux Flamands-Wallons, les célébrations se sont poursuivies jusque tard dans la nuit avec les supporters de Beerschot."
ktgfla.4.a: "A fine day for Katanga!"

ktgfla.5.t: "Muhemili Abeli against the UMHK"
ktgfla.5.d: "After getting caught for stealing a bed, 7 chairs, 5 tables and even a washbasin, Muhemili Abeli has been brought to trial for repeated theft and trade with the black market. She countered that due to the reforms pushed by UMHK after the Black Monday scandal, many of the workers can't afford their life necessities anymore and that she resulted to stealing to sustain her family. Support for her case has been growing in the cite indigène where many more miners have fallen on tough times after the firing of 300 miners last year."
ktgfla.5.a: "Start aid measures."

ktgfla.6.t: "Further scandals in the UMHK"
 ktgfla.6.d: "A study in the Ludwigsstadt paper has been published outlining the atrocities committed by the UMHK against the Hutu population of Rwanda. By promising them wealth and success, many unemployed men have travelled to Ludwigsstadt to be employed in the mines. Insisting that they are naturally protected against low oxygen environments due to their mountainous home and don't need the 'Chambres à Vapeur' to acclimatise to the situation down below, many of these men have died from loss of oxygen or malaria and secretly buried away from the general public. Now the study has leaked out to the population of Ludwigsstadt resulting in a massive strike against the UMHK until better working conditions can be guaranteed. Over in the Colonial government, debate is also occurring over the replacement of the Chefs in the mine of question to deter exploding anti-colonialist thoughts."
ktgfla.6.a: "Fire all the Overseers."

ktgfla.7.t: "Conflict within the UMHK"
 ktgfla.7.d: "In continuation of the pre-Weltkrieg colonial policy, the UMHK has once again dedicated itself to a combination of complex bureaucracy and a general patronising attitude towards its workers. Due to the expansion of the corporation over the years however this combination is no longer viable for the entire firm leading to loopholes and unjustified punitive measures against the wrong miner. After the economic crisis of 1936, many of the miners are now completely at the mercy of the company, depending on them for food, social facilities, accommodation. To cut back their losses, the UMHK decided to cut back spending for these facilities, causing a general decline in the welfare of the Katangese and increasing calls for better loans and houses now that the economy is back in upswing."
ktgfla.7.a: "Discuss with the UMHK board of directors."

ktgfla.8.t: "Workshop burned down"
ktgfla.8.d: "Near the Ruashi mines, fires have burned down multiple workshops causing the work to come to a complete stop. It looks like it was a deliberate act of arson by some of the workers as a protest against the low wages and old housing facilities."
ktgfla.8.a: "Improve the housing facilities."

ktgfla.9.t: "UMHK demolishes a cemetery"
 ktgfla.9.d: "Lors de l'expansion récente des mines de cobalt dans le Sud-Katanga, un groupe d'ingénieurs en construction flamands et wallons a accidentellement détruit un cimetière local, provoquant l'indignation de la population qui affirme que les coloniaux n'ont aucun respect pour leur culture et leurs traditions et qu'ils ne sont là que pour le profit. À Ludwigsstadt, la situation s'envenime : de nombreux magasins et cafés tenus par des coloniaux se font tabasser et l'UMHK est en grève générale. Le gouvernement colonial se demande s'il doit profiter de l'occasion pour enfin achever la nationalisation de l'UMHK, obligeant ainsi la société à changer directement sa politique et à offrir de meilleures conditions de travail à la main-d'œuvre autochtone."
ktgfla.9.a: "Nationalise the UMHK."
ktgfla.9.b: "Leave the company independent."

ktgfla.10.t: "General strike of Ludwigsstadt"
 ktgfla.10.d: "After yet another large amount of lay-offs at the UMHK without compensation, hundreds of miners have gathered in the Stade Roi Adelbert to confront the mayor of the city and discuss possible repercussions for the UMHK. Due to a planned visit to Bunkeya however, Pierre Ryckmans wasn't able to meet with the strikers and has sent his deputy Amour Maron to handle the situation. When Léonard Mpoyi and his colleagues however started presenting their evidence to the gathered council, Amour Maron shot the man next to Mpoyi point blank and ordered the Force Publique to open fire on the strikers. Over 50 miners were shot dead with hundreds of wounded. The strike has been quelled but for how long...?"
ktgfla.10.a: "Increase the Force Publique garrison in the cité indigène."

ktgfla.11.t: "Mutiny in the Ludwigsstadt Barracks"
 ktgfla.11.d: "Instigué par la réaction agressive d'Amour contre les grévistes de l'UMHK, le premier sergent-major Ngoie Mukalabushi s'est révolté contre l'administration coloniale en collaborant avec Mpoyi pour saper le régime flamand-wallon et apporter l'indépendance totale au Katanga. Des centaines de mineurs suivant Mpoyi se sont joints à la Force Publique mutinée, se frayant un chemin dans le quartier blanc pour renverser le régime."
 ktgfla.11.a: "Reinforcements from Bunkeya quell the revolt."
ktgfla.11.b: "Colonial rule is once again overthrown."

ktgfla.12.t: "Death of Jeanie Prentice"
ktgfla.12.d: "Arriving in Congo in 1900 as part of the English Garanganze evangelical mission, Jeanie Prentice greatly defined the influence of the church in Katanga. When she finally died last Friday, she was the oldest living colonial in Congo and loved by both the colonials as the Katangese."
ktgfla.12.a: "A sad day for Katanga."

ktgfla.13.t: "Assassination attempt of Père Raphaël"
 ktgfla.13.d: "At 5.16 pm today a car bomb shook Ludwigsstadt when the car that was supposed to transport Père Raphaël from the colonial headquarters to the Stade Roi Adelbert exploded killing the driver and wounding 8 more people. It's unclear who could have targeted the much adored père who responsible for the introduction of football in the colony but reports indicate that a radical member of the Garanganze tribe may have detonated the bomb to express his distrust of the ever increasing power of the Catholic Church. His attempt seemed to have caused the opposite with more and more citizens deciding to abandon their tribal past and become part of the growing population of évolués in the cities."
ktgfla.13.a: "Thank God he wasn't hurt."
