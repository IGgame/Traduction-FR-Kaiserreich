### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_AMADEO_SAVOY_DESC: "Amedeo of Savoy-Aosta, cousin of the former King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel the Disgraced, is King of Sardinia-Piedmont. However, his title to Piedmont is little more than an empty claim, for he, and the remnants of the Royal Army who support him and fled the peninsula to join him, have lost Piedmont to the hated Socialist Republic of Italy. Closely aligned with the French Exiles, to the point claiming him to be a puppet would not be out of place, he sees not only Piedmont but all of Italy as under foreign occupation and seeks to liberate it, but he has also to deal with the ever contentious relationship between Exiles and Sardinians, both of whom question the uneasy balance that has established itself in Sardinia."

 SRD_governmental_reform: "Governmental Reform"
 SRD_governmental_reform_desc: "Corruption has run rampant in our government ever since we left the continent in shameful exile. If we are ever to return to the mainland and resume our rightful leadership over Italy, in any sort of form, we have to root out problem bureaucrats, nepotistic laws, and antiquated systems."
 SRD_new_constitution: "New Constitution"
 SRD_new_constitution_desc: "Our Rule over Sardinia has been undemocratic and backed with unspoken pledges and hidden loyalties. Amedeo has demanded the formation of a new, free and fair constitution and wishes to rule as a Constitutional Monarch. We shall being preparations straight away."

 SRD_strengthen_democracy: "Strengthen Democracy"
 SRD_strengthen_democracy_desc: "We need to ensure that even in small mountainous towns in the centre of the island, people know the rule of law, and the people's decisions, elect and empower those in charge.

 SRD_freedom_of_speech: "Worker's Rights"
 SRD_freedom_of_speech_desc: "Now that we are moving swiftly, and mostly smoothly into a more free and open society, we need to make sure that the government guarantees rights of workers.

 SRD_constitutional_monarchy: "Constitutional Monarchy"
 SRD_constitutional_monarchy_desc: "We need to adjust our laws to accommodate the fact that we still have a royal family, but the people make the majority of the decisions.

 SRD_homecoming: "Home-Coming"
 SRD_homecoming_desc: "We have worked out the issues with our government, and made sure to have popular support as well. It's high time to remind the people that we won't stay isolated on this island forever. Instead, we need to make a victorious return to the mainland!"

 SRD_unification: "Begin Risorgimento"

 SRD_destroy_two_sicilies: "Strike at the False Kingdom"
 SRD_destroy_two_sicilies_desc: "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies ceased to exist in 1860 after an invasion by the Glorious Hero Giuseppe Garibaldi. It appears these pretenders need to be reminded of this event."
 SRD_italian_irredentism: "Italian Irredentism"
 SRD_italian_irredentism_desc: "We may be close to reuniting Italy, but Italian lands are still in the hands of foreigners. The lands in their mountainous ares of Tyrol, and coastal areas in the eastern Adriatic remain outside of our grasp. We will also need to decide if we should let Malta slip from our grip entirely, or bring it back into the fold of our Thalassocracy."
 SRD_industralize_the_south: "Industrialise the South"
 SRD_industralize_the_south_desc: "Now that we have a firm control of the southern Italian peninsula, we need to integrate it into the industrial base of our island nation. We need to unite the disparate small industries of the southern peninsula into a few companies that can do the work of Italy."
 SRD_sardinia_piedmont: "Proclaim Sardinia-Piedmont"
 SRD_sardinia_piedmont_desc: "With Piedmont under our control, we can finally declare we have our heritage back. Sardinia-Piedmont was a great power in the 18th and 19th centuries, and we have brought back its former glory. We will rule northern Italy again!"
 SRD_university_of_turin: "Fund the University of Turin"
 SRD_university_of_turin_desc: "The University of Turin is one of the oldest universities in Europe, and it has a proud intellectual tradition, boasting such names as Erasmus, Amedeo Avagadro, and Joseph de Maistre in its roll of former graduates and faculty. We should make the institution the centrepiece of our national research."
 SRD_promote_sardinian: "Promote Sardo"
 SRD_promote_sardinian_desc: "The language of Sardinia, Sardo, is a remarkably rich language with Catalan, Latin, Spanish, and even Arabic influences. Let us spread this language to the mainland and improve their cultural heritage."

 SRD_rebuild_piedmont_desc: "We need to rebuild the historical site of our capital. The syndicalists ran the infrastructure and businesses into the ground. Of course, those who destroy Italian infrastructure and wealth are not welcome here, and should be removed as well."

### Focus - economy ###
 SRD_assess_the_economy: "Assess the Economy"
 SRD_assess_the_economy_desc: "We assumed our exile to Sardinia would be temporary, less than a year, but a year turned into two, and two turned into five, and five turned into ten... it's time to assess our economy and figure out how to best optimise the little we have remaining. We're going to need all the resources and power this tiny island can provide if we are ever to get back to the mainland ourselves!"
 SRD_industrial_investment: "Industrial Investments"
 SRD_industrial_investment_desc: "We don't have the manpower or resources to run a lot of factories, but what we can do is get them to run better. We need to start massively investing in new technologies that can help us run our factories more cheaply, more efficiently, or more productively."
 SRD_farming_grants: "Farming Grants"
 SRD_farming_grants_desc: "Our little island doesn't produce much food, and now that we have a mostly hostile coastline in Europe, we have been struggling to get adequate supplies of food. We need to provide some incentives to local farmers in central Sardinia so we can get more food to the more populous coastal regions that used to rely on France or northern Italy for their sundries."
 SRD_coal_mines: "Expand the Coal Mines"
 SRD_coal_mines_desc: "Sardinia is rich with coal to plunder from the earth. These new supplies of coal will better help us turn some low grade iron into good steel for use in our military industry."
 SRD_civilian_investments: "Civilian Investments"
 SRD_civilian_investments_desc: "Our meagre civilian industry will not be able to support the large-scale military industrial complex we will need to return to the mainland victoriously. We need at least a bare minimum of construction industry, cement and wood fabrication for buildings, and machine tools if we are to embark upon a wide-scale re-armament program."
 SRD_military_investments: "Military Investments"
 SRD_military_investments_desc: "The Entente has experienced some difficulty getting new arms to us in the past decade. The French Republic is in a similar situation to us, and Canada is very far away. We need to be more self-sufficient in the production of small arms and aircraft if we are to defend ourselves, let alone free our countrymen from the upstart warlords and pretend republics that plague our motherland."
 SRD_new_economy: "New Economy"
 SRD_new_economy_desc: "Clearly we cannot rely on a German economic hegemony to prop up our economy. We have to be more self-sufficient, and target a few profitable and popular exports to re-orient our economy. When this is finished, Black Monday should be no more than a poor memory, and Sardinia will be able to move forward into a better, richer future."
 SRD_economic_protection: "Economic Protection"
 SRD_economic_protection_desc: "Sardinia hasn't always been a place of opportunity and wealth, and we need to persuade new companies to build new factories and open their doors to the world. We will set up a series of economic protections to safeguard them from the worst risks in our new economy so they can get setup and thrive without risk of failure."
 SRD_market_protections: "Market Protections"
 SRD_market_protections_desc: "With new factories and natural resources comes the risk of market fluctuations and speculative trading driving some market volatility. The recent world tension doesn't make this any better. Let's enact a series of market reforms and protections to ensure stability in our markets."
 SRD_new_industry: "New Industry"
 SRD_new_industry_desc: "Now that we have arrived in force back on the mainland and declared our ambitions, our next step is the integration of our Island economy with a mainland economy. Sea routes, transfers or supplies and materials, all of this will take time, and we need to be more efficient with this. Get the researchers looking into better industrial methods!"
 SRD_automotive_industry: "Automotive Industry"
 SRD_automotive_industry_desc: "Horses are increasingly being replaced with cars, in both civilian and military use. We need to get ahead of this trend and start widescale production of motor vehicles for both our army and our citizens. Lets provide huge subsidies for companies willing to produce motorised vehicles and start purchasing them for our military as well."
 SRD_autostrada: "Create the Autostrada"
 SRD_autostrada_desc: "New cars and trucks require new roads on which to drive them. Imitating the Germans of the North, we will build a great expanse of highways stretching across Piedmont, eventually connecting to Austria, France, and Germany as time goes on."
 SRD_dockyards: "Genoese Dockyards"
 SRD_dockyards_desc: "In antiquity, the Genoa was a shipbuilding powerhouse. Even after unification it continued to produce ships, but it has languished under the great Italian divide. No more. We will rebuild the Genoese shipyards to their former glory, providing ships to complement or island navy."
 SRD_air_ports: "Expand Airports"
 SRD_air_ports_desc: "With our control stretching across vast swaths of Italy, we are needing additional modes of transportation, and extra supply bases for our aircraft. Lets construct small airbases across the peninsula to facilitate transportation and resupply."
 SRD_industralize_piedmont: "Industrialise Piedmont"
 SRD_industralize_piedmont_desc: "Now that we have solidified control of our ancestral home of Piedmont, we need to get down to the serious business of industrialising it as we have our island refuge. We need to lay the foundations of good construction companies and consumer goods factories to rebuild Italy, and serve our interests."
 SRD_civilian_subsides: "Business Grants"
 SRD_civilian_subsides_desc: "Now that we have expanded our reach into the Italian Peninsula, we should expand the grants we have had for our island companies to ones on the mainland as well. They worked well on Sardinia, and they will work even better with all the natural resources and population of Italy."
 SRD_radio: "Radio Companies"
 SRD_radio_desc: "Radio is proving to be invaluable on and off the battlefield. Communication is expanding at an astounding rate, but leaving us with a huge demand for transistors and capacitors to run our new radios. We need to found a new radio company to provide these precious resources!"
 SRD_university: "Expand the University of Cagliari"
 SRD_university_desc: "Cagliari University was a shining establishment within the former kingdom, we shall now expand it to meet our research needs."
 SRD_economic_miracle: "Economic Miracle"
 SRD_economic_miracle_desc: "With the integration of Piedmont through the Autostrada, and the industrial development of airports, dockyards, a new automotive industry, and electronics, we have crafted an economy that is both more productive, and less reliant on foreign goods. Not only can we make more for our people, but it takes less resources to do so! Truly an economic miracle."

### Focus - army ###
 SRD_assess_the_army: "The Loyal Men of Sardinia"
 SRD_assess_the_army_desc: "It is imperative on us to ensure that the Army receives the royal attention that it deserves. We will need every man willing and able to fight in order to reclaim the birthright."
 SRD_superior_fire_power_plan: "Superior Firepower"
 SRD_superior_fire_power_plan_desc: "Sardinia may not have a lot of men, but what we can have is every man firing a gun. The more we can concentrate firepower onto an area of the battlefield, the more we can overwhelm our foes with ordnance and artillery, the less they will be able to react. What better way to greet our enemies on the beaches, but with a wall of explosive lead?"
 SRD_elite_army: "An Elite Army"
 SRD_elite_army_desc: "We don't have many men, but what we do have is an abundance of time, and a vast will to be better than our myriad array of enemies. Let us develop special forces for fighting in the mountains, dropping out of the air onto our enemies, and invading them from the sea, and let them be more numerous than our enemies."
 SRD_carabinieri: "The Carabinieri"
 SRD_carabinieri_desc: "Our Carabinieri have always been a central part of our armed forces, and an integral part of the first unification of Italy. Let's develop and expand this ancient police force, starting on the island of its birth. For if we are to re-unite Italy, we will need the police force to help pacify and police it."
 SRD_artillery_effort: "Artillery Effort"
 SRD_artillery_effort_desc: "For decades our divisions have been saddled with the antiquated Model 16 howitzer, in part because of its coastal defence use in the 1920s. This situation must be rectified sooner rather than later and new artillery developed."
 SRD_arditi: "The Arditi"
 SRD_arditi_desc: "We were among the first countries in the Weltkrieg to learn that slow rolling firepower did nothing to armed men in trenches. Instead our shock troops became a model imitated by other countries. We need to use our background in assault forces to make shock troops to invade the mainland!"
 SRD_arma_del_genio: "Arma Del Genio"
 SRD_arma_del_genio_desc: "Sardinia has always had a long history of brilliant army engineers. In the Weltkrieg this was expanded to include medical personal and electronic operators. We need new technology so our medics, support technicians, and especially army engineers can excel in this new age of warfare."
 SRD_mobile_war_plan: "Mobile Warfare Plan"
 SRD_mobile_war_plan_desc: "Sardinia may not have a lot of men, but a lot of men aren't needed when you can get behind your opponent to stab him in the back. We can train our troops to move quickly, not get bogged down in extensive fighting, and train our motorised and armoured units to split and surround our enemies, which will lead to their quick destruction. What better way to storm the beaches than by spending almost no time there at all?"
 SRD_fast_army: "A Mobile Army"
 SRD_fast_army_desc: "Our plan for being a mobile force needs just one more thing; a way to move our troops around quickly. Let us upgrade our soft shell trucks and jeeps to partially armoured half tracks and mechanised personal carriers. These can supplement, and hopefully replace our weaker vehicles in the months ahead and provide better protection for our elite army."
 SRD_bersaglieri: "The Bersaglieri"
 SRD_bersaglieri_desc: "Let us augment our infantry divisions with battalions of our finest Bersaglieri. Their speed and finesse is an important contribution to our mobile warfare doctrine, as even without vehicles our infantry will not be passed by anyone! We need to develop and expand these forces to make sure every division has some of these fine, elite soldiers at their disposal."
 SRD_infantry_tank: "Infantry Tanks"
 SRD_infantry_tank_desc: "Our tanks need to keep up with the development of our other armoured vehicles, specifically the focus on speed and manoeuvrability. Our new infantry tanks will be able to support our fast moving motorised and mechanised units, and assist in cutting and destroying enemy units by breaking through the hardest points in the enemy defences."
 SRD_light_royal_legion: "Royal Light Legion"
 SRD_light_royal_legion_desc: "We can expand the training of our Bersaglieri, and the spirit of that training, to encompass our entire army. It will make our motorised and mechanised units tougher, faster, and improve the overall coordination between all military units in our army. None will outrun the Royal Light Legion of Sardinia!"

### Focus - navy ###
 SRD_battleship_plan: "Cavagnari's Plan"
 SRD_battleship_plan_desc: "Cavagnari is a veteran of the Weltkrieg and saw the effectiveness of large ships of the line. He is our biggest proponent of Battlecruisers and Dreadnoughts, and strongly recommends we begin to lay down the hulls of several large ships if we want to wrest control of the Mediterranean away from our enemies."
 SRD_carrier_plan: "Iachino's Plan"
 SRD_carrier_plan_desc: "Angelo Iachino's experience with torpedo boats during the Weltkrieg has led him to some fairly unconventional ideas involving airpower and runways on the water. We are Italian, and we will continue to innovate as the threat of another great war looms. We just hope he is right about the coming strength of airpower on the open sea."
 SRD_sub_plan: "Legnani's Plan"
 SRD_sub_plan_desc: "Legnani has come to us with his own proposal: choking the life from the communards of France and our homeland using submarine warfare. We have our allies with their giant shipyards across the Atlantic, let us supplement their fleets with our stealthy undersea craft, and bring starvation and ruin to our enemies!"
 SRD_reform_navy: "Reform the Navy"
 SRD_reform_navy_desc: "Regardless of the direction in which we take our navy in terms of ship building, we desperately need to update our navy tactics. The last time we had significant differences in training was back in 1917 when the peninsula was newly united. It's back to school for all our naval officers!"
 SRD_expand_dockyards: "Expand the Dockyards"
 SRD_expand_dockyards_desc: "The Dockyards of Cagliari must be expanded if are to ever build our own vessels once more. While it may take up valuable space we could use for other industry, without control over the waters of the Mediterranean we will be a ripe target for some Communard to tear from the branches of Italy."
 SRD_sardinian_merchant_navy: "Merchant Marine"
 SRD_sardinian_merchant_navy_desc: "With our new dockyards built and ready for orders, the time is ripe for building a new merchant fleet. We can improve the design of our ships to keep the same capacity while costing less, and at the same time revamp our escort procedures to make sure we lose less of them if they are attacked."
 SRD_continue_reforms: "Continue Reforms"
 SRD_continue_reforms_desc: "While our reforms are well under way and going extremely well, this is not the time for complacency. Our reforms must reach every aspect of our navy, and continue to drive forward our naval dominance."
 SRD_submarines: "Submarines"
 SRD_submarines_desc: "Our current submarines are adequate, if not spectacular. Legnani has ordered that we develop submarines that are faster and longer range, which we will need if we ever want to extend our reach beyond the waters of the Mediterranean."
 SRD_cruisers: "Cruisers"
 SRD_cruisers_desc: "While our submarines are impressive, to say the least, we still will need surface vessels to guard our convoys and do some additional spotting. Let's design some cruisers to help with trade interdiction, and protect our submarines from hostile destroyers."
 SRD_armoured_cruisers: "Armoured Cruisers"
 SRD_armoured_cruisers_desc: "Now that we have designs for Dreadnoughts, we need to make sure we have a powerful escort force for our titans of the sea. While still large, armoured cruisers can sail in front of our mighty behemoths and protect them from smaller craft while our big guns pound enemy capital ships into submission."
 SRD_battleships: "Dreadnoughts"
 SRD_battleships_desc: "Now that the basics of our new fleet have been worked out, it is time to design some truly great Dreadnoughts to augment our existing fleet, the first of which shall be our new mighty flagship. It's a wonder of modern engineering that we were able to build such large ships on such a small island, but such is the power of Sardinia!"
 SRD_marine_focus: "The Sardinian Marine Force"
 SRD_marine_focus_desc: "There is no excuse for us not to exploit the talents of the hardy island people under our stewardship. Proposals have been put forward to capitalise on this and encourage the specialised training of Marine detachments."
 SRD_synthetic_research: "Synthetic Research"
 SRD_synthetic_research_desc: "Having no natural resources of our own apart from the meagre bounty of Piedmont, we need to invest in new ways of acquiring the lifeblood of modern warfare: oil, and its potential derivative rubber. If we ever hope to become even vaguely self-sufficient we will need amply supply of both these resources."
 SRD_carriers: "Carriers"
 SRD_carriers_desc: "As our air fleet expands, and more importantly as our planes expand, they will need every larger places to take off and land. Let's commission a new naval study on the feasibility of a larger aircraft carrier to carry even more planes. Iachino has gotten this far and we continue to put out faith in him."
 SRD_naval_aviation: "Fleet of the Skies"
 SRD_naval_aviation_desc: "We must not ignore the simple fact that we are an island surrounded by the azure Mediterranean Sea. A fleet of powerful naval bombers would allow us to strike at foreign fleets and docks, and help us permanently dominate Mare Nostrum."
 SRD_thalassocracy: "Proclaim Thalassocracy"
 SRD_thalassocracy_desc: "Through rapid development, research of new doctrine and new ships of the line, and an overall strategy of naval superiority, we can declare without doubt that the majority of our power comes from the sea. We may never dominate all of Europe, but the coastlines of the Italian Peninsula shall be ours, forever guarded by our Royal navy."

### Focus - Airport ###
 SRD_airforce: "The Sardinian Air Fleet"
 SRD_airforce_desc: "It has been said by learned theorists that the future of modern conflict lies in the air. We must begin formalising the creation of a dedicated Air Fleet, complete with bases, to ensure that we are not left behind."
 SRD_pilot_training: "Pilot Training"
 SRD_pilot_training_desc: "We have to be careful when improving our aircraft; if our pilots cannot handle the craft all our effort will be wasted. We need to create a fine air school for our pilots, and make sure their training is up to modern standards for our new aircraft."
 SRD_expand_air_ports: "Expand Military Air Bases"
 SRD_expand_air_ports_desc: "There will be some work expanding our airfields for military aircraft, as we need to clear large uninterrupted areas for our runways. At least we should be able to use the many hills in the region as good locations for our air traffic control towers."
 SRD_aviation_companies: "Aviation Companies"
 SRD_aviation_companies_desc: "Now that we have better plane designs we need to make sure that the companies manufacturing them are as productive and efficient as possible. Let's invest in specialised production facilities for our aircraft to reduce the cost and time required to manufacture them."
 SRD_fighters: "Fighters"
 SRD_fighters_desc: "The major goal of our air force is never ceding control of the sky, and to this end we will develop the most advanced fighters Italy has ever seen!"
 SRD_bombers: "Bombers"
 SRD_bombers_desc: "The major goal of our air force is supporting the troops on the ground, and to this end we will develop the most advanced close support planes Italy has ever seen!"
 SRD_expand_aviation_industry: "Air Defence Corps"
 SRD_expand_aviation_industry_desc: "As an island nation we always run the risk of being backed into a corner, and this applies equally to the air. We need adequate anti-aircraft coverage over our island to stop the ever present threat of bombing and paratroopers."
 SRD_paracadutisti: "Paracadutisti"
 SRD_paracadutisti_desc: "One of our pilots has had an unorthodox idea: what if we had people voluntarily jump out of airplanes? Initial tests have been promising, and we want to assemble a few paracadutisti brigades and send them through battlefield testing."
 SRD_radar: "Radar"
 SRD_radar_desc: "Now that we have excellent pilot training and more up to date aircraft, we need to improve our target acquisition. RADAR has shown to be promising in early tests, and we want to build a few stations to try them out large scale."
 SRD_rule_the_skies: "Rule the Skies"
 SRD_rule_the_skies_desc: "We have all the evidence we need to show us how transforming air power is on the battlefield. It is desperately important that we never cede control of any part of the battlefield to our enemy, airspace especially. We will do everything in our power to secure the skies above us!"

### Events ###

 srd.0.t: "The Kingdom of Sardinia"
 srd.0.d: "The Kingdom of Sardinia was born amidst the ashes of the Weltkrieg. King Vittorio Emanuele signed an armistice with the Austrian government in 1919, but furious socialists, radical nationalists and other rabble rose up against his government. He and his son abdicated, and in Sardinia, marked by few, King Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta, assumed the throne. However, our pretensions to the Italian throne came to an end in 1920, when the Austrians forced the Italian Federation onto the united White forces in mainland Italy. The British forced us to join the Federation as the Austrians demanded, unwilling to anger the Germans and break the Armistice signed at Copenhagen. We withdrew from the Italian Federation in 1926 after the British Empire collapsed and the Austrians withdrew from Italy to deal with internal affairs, though we were still dissuaded from claiming all of Italy until Piedmont is reclaimed This made us a nominally independent nation, though in reality we are almost a puppet state of the French Republic.\n\nThis sombre state of affairs is made no better by internal divisions at home. King Amedeo replaced his father Emanuele Filiberto as King of Sardinia just five years ago, and rules as an absolute monarch, upsetting many who feel that constitutional monarchy is the only path to progress. This fundamental question, between absolutism and constitutionalism, has divided the island since the end of the Weltkrieg, and there is little doubt that the current arrangement is simply untenable. Corruption runs rampant and the judiciary and government both require reform, problems without solutions under the current political deadlock, and without which Sardinia will never be able to take what is rightfully hers."
 srd.0.a: "Long Live the King!"

### Political Events 1 - 10 ###
 srd.1.t: "Government Reforms"
 srd.1.d.absolute_monarchy: "If Sardinia is to be cleansed of corruption, the first step toward realising this goal is bureaucratic reform, to which there are two main approaches. One would involve the creation of a new meritocratic civil service, while the other would create a system of patronage through which ministers could be directly appointed by the King himself.\n\nIn either case, the existing bureaucracy will be replaced, but each has implications for the future of the government as a whole."
