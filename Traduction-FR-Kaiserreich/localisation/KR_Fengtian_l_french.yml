FNG_CHI_CONQUERED:0 "Nous avons unifié la Chine"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_i:0 "Fortifier la Manchourie"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_i_desc:0 "Les montagnes du Yan au sud, la chaîne du Petit Khigan à l'ouest et le golfe Bohai à l'est créent une forteresse naturelle autour de la plaine de Mandchourie, le col Shanhai étant le seul accès facile à cette dernière. Il est facile de fortifier le Nord-Est quand la nature a déjà fait tant de travail."
FNG_The_National_Reclamation_War:0 "La Guerre de Reconquête nationale"
FNG_The_National_Reclamation_War_desc:0 "Le temps est venu de reconquérir le Sud et de renverser l'Empire Qing décadent. La nation se rallie derrière son leader dans la marche vers la victoire !"
FNG_Backward_Industry:0 "Industrie arriérée"
FNG_Backward_Industry_desc:0 "Bien que Fengtian abrite la deuxième plus grande base industrielle d'Asie de l'Est, sa taille cache des machines obsolètes, des pratiques inefficaces et une gestion très mauvaise.

FNG_Unscrupulous_Governance:0 "Gouvernement sans scrupules"
FNG_Unscrupulous_Governance_desc:0 "Malgré ses affirmations contraires, le gouvernement de Fengtian est en proie à une corruption endémique, à l'incompétence et à l'abus de pouvoir. Bien que cela n'ait rien d'inhabituel en Chine, cela entrave le bon fonctionnement du gouvernement et limite le soutien au régime."
FNG_Investment_Dearth:0 "Pénurie d'investissements"
FNG_Investment_Dearth_desc:0 "L'effondrement économique qui a suivi l'entrée de Fengtian dans les guerres civiles a gravement endommagé sa base fiscale et sa crédibilité financière, laissant le gouvernement avec peu de créanciers et les entreprises privées avec des options très limitées. Peu d'entre eux ont la confiance nécessaire pour investir au Fengtian, que ce soit dans l'économie du pays ou à l'étranger."
FNG_Investment_Dearth_Japanese:0 "Investissement chinois limité"
FNG_Investment_Dearth_Japanese_desc:0 "Grâce aux incitations gouvernementales, les investissements japonais ont augmenté, mais il y a toujours une pénurie générale. Des investissements chinois locaux pourraient nous fournir les fonds dont nous avons besoin."
FNG_Investment_Dearth_Chinese:0 "Investissement japonais limité"
FNG_Investment_Dearth_Chinese_desc:0 "Grâce aux incitations gouvernementales, l'investissement privé chinois a augmenté, mais il y a toujours une pénurie générale. Les investissements japonais pourraient nous fournir les fonds dont nous avons besoin."

FNG_Buying_Silver:0 "Acheter de l'argent"
FNG_Buying_Silver_desc:0 "L'argent, par définition, est cher et le gouvernement en achète actuellement en grande quantité. Une fois que la réserve sera pleine, cependant, il disposera d'une assise fiable pour la monnaie et le crédit."
FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse:0 "Effondrement de la Banque Centrale"
FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse_desc:0 "La Banque Centrale semble avoir égaré des millions de taels d'argent précisément parce que les banques japonaises ont demandé le remboursement de leurs prêts. Comment cela a-t-il pu arriver ?"
FNG_Japanese_Military_Mission:0 "Mission militaire japonaise"
FNG_Japanese_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Le Japon est présent militairement dans le Fengtian depuis au moins le début des années 20, mais l'intervention de 1926 a vu l'envoi d'une mission militaire permanente, qui fournit une aide militaire et "conseille" le gouvernement. Malheureusement, ne pas tenir compte de ces conseils peut avoir des conséquences désastreuses."
FNG_Educational_Vacuum:0 "Vide éducatif"
FNG_Educational_Vacuum_desc:0 "L'absence soudaine d'enseignants, de professeurs et de scientifiques japonais a laissé un vide éducatif inquiétant. Il est possible de trouver des remplaçants à l'étranger et au pays, mais à un coût non négligeable et non sans grands inconvénients."
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1:0 "Chaos post-colonial"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1_desc:0 "Même dans sa forme la plus limitée, l'emprise du Mantetsu sur l'économie et l'infrastructure de Fengtian était étroite, et maintenant que ses systèmes et structures soigneusement posés s'effondrent, le pays dans son ensemble est paralysé. Il lui faudra du temps pour se reconstruire et se réorganiser, mais si l'influence du Mantetsu avait été plus grande, cela aurait pu être bien pire."
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2:0 "Chaos post-colonial"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2_desc:0 "L'emprise du Mantetsu sur la politique, l'économie et l'infrastructure de Fengtian était étroite, et maintenant que ses systèmes et structures soigneusement posés s'effondrent, le pays dans son ensemble est paralysé. Il lui faudra du temps pour se reconstruire et se réorganiser, mais si l'influence du Mantetsu avait été encore plus grande, cela aurait pu être pire."
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3:0 "Chaos post-colonial"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3_desc:0 "L'emprise du Mantetsu sur la politique, l'économie et l'infrastructure de Fengtian était asphyxiante, et maintenant que ses systèmes et structures soigneusement conçus s'écroulent, le pays tout entier est totalement paralysé. Il lui faudra beaucoup de temps pour se reconstruire et se réorganiser."

FNG_Army_Dominance:0 "Domination de l'armée"
FNG_Army_Dominance_desc:0 "La Clique de Zhang et l'armée ont un contrôle total sur le gouvernement, ce qui pousse les autres factions politiques à se tourner vers des moyens non conventionnels pour limiter leur contrôle. Malheureusement, ces méthodes et les abus de pouvoir de la Clique de Zhang ont des conséquences désastreuses."
FNG_Plutocratic_Exploitation:0 "Exploitation ploutocratique"
FNG_Plutocratic_Exploitation_desc:0 "L'emprise de fer de la Clique des Communications sur le gouvernement de la nation lui a permis de franchir un tout nouveau palier d'exploitation et d'avidité, réduisant la légitimité de l'État et suscitant une pression politique japonaise sans précédent."
FNG_Japan_Deal:0 "Investissements des Zaibatsu"
FNG_Ma_Gold_Transfer_Negative:0 "Le transfert de l'Or de Ma"

FNG_Intel_Leak_desc:0 "Par incompétence grossière, ou pour des raisons encore moins vertueuses, le chef du renseignement a divulgué des renseignements vitaux aux ennemis du gouvernement."
FNG_Legations_Deal:0 "L'Affaire des Légations"
FNG_Legations_Deal_desc:0 "Grâce à une politique intelligente, et peut-être à des " négociations " en coulisse, le ministre de l'Économie a obtenu un accord commercial précieux avec les Cités de la Légation."

FNG_informal_empire_1_desc:0 "Le temps est venu de déclarer notre indépendance, de chasser les intrus japonais de Chine et de mettre fin à un siècle d'insupportable humiliation nationale !"
FNG_informal_empire_2:0 "Préservation de l'Ordre de Xinhai"
FNG_informal_empire_2_desc:0 "Fengtian est le seul gouvernement permanent à maintenir l'ordre établi par la révolution de  Xinhai en 1911, qui appelait au renversement des Qing et à l'établissement d'une République. C'est là le fondement de la légitimité du gouvernement."
FNG_informal_empire_3:0 "Influence du Mantetsu"
FNG_informal_empire_3_desc:0 "L'influence économique du Mantetsu s'étend à l'ensemble du pays et de l'Assemblée. Bien que le gouvernement soit déterminé à résister en privé, ses efforts s'affaiblissent de jour en jour."
FNG_informal_empire_4:0 "Influence omniprésente du Mantetsu"
FNG_informal_empire_4_desc:0 "Nos usines grondent d'activité, produisant des armes, des fournitures et des commodités quotidiennes à un rythme effarant. Rien de tout cela ne serait possible sans le Japon, mais les murmures de mécontentement se multiplient. Les étrangers exploitent la Chine depuis trop longtemps."
FNG_informal_empire_5:0 "Domination du Mantetsu"
FNG_informal_empire_5_desc:0 "L'expertise japonaise et l'influence du Mantetsu propulsent Fengtian vers l'avant d'une manière que l'on croyait auparavant impossible, mais la plupart du contrôle est en réalité passé des mains de l'Assemblée à celles du Japon. Le Grand Maréchal est seul devant le pouvoir écrasant du Mantetsu dans le pays."

### Leader Descriptions ###
FNG_zhang_zuolin_desc:0 "Né dans une famille pauvre près de Shenyang, Zhang Zuolin a commencé son ascension fulgurante comme un bandit exploitant la situation militaire chaotique de la fin de l'ère Guangxu. Malgré son analphabétisme et son manque d'éducation formelle, le 'Vieux Maréchal' est compétent et conscient de ses propres déficiences, heureux de demander conseil et de déléguer si nécessaire. \n\nCependant, il est aussi connu pour son humeur colérique et sa nature implacable, et profondément rancunière. Zhang est aussi parfois très égocentrique, ayant autrefois ruiné toute l'économie du Nord-Est pour soutenir ses efforts de guerre, et ainsi, en termes idéologiques, on pourrait le définir comme résolument "Pro-Zhang"."

### Focuses ###
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order:0 "Préservation de l'Ordre Xinhai"
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc:0 "Ironiquement, Fengtian est le seul gouvernement national à maintenir l'ordre établi par la révolution Xinhai de 1911, qui appelait au renversement des Qing et à l'établissement d'une République. Bien que ses engagements républicains soient discutables et que la reconquête du Sud soit actuellement impossible, le gouvernement a fortement défendu ces deux objectifs, car ils renforcent sa légitimité nationale."
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing:0 "Fuguo Qiangbing"
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing_desc:0 "Traduit grossièrement par " Enrichir le pays, renforcer l'armée ", ce proverbe remonte à d'anciens philosophes légalistes, mais a été utilisé plus récemment pour inspirer des réformes à l'ère Guangxu en Chine et à l'ère Meiji au Japon. Aujourd'hui, il est à nouveau appliqué à Fengtian, alors que le gouvernement cherche à moderniser et, à terme, à frapper le Sud occupé par la renaissante dynastie Qing, et à partir de là, à établir un contrôle sur toute la Chine."
#Enrich the Country Branch
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation:0 "Enrichir le pays"
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation_desc:0 "La force de la Mandchourie réside dans ses ressources naturelles abondantes, qualifiées par les publications japonaises de " corne d'abondance ", et ses gisements de ressources stratégiques comme le charbon et le fer ont été qualifiés de " ressources d'importance mondiale ". Avec un peu d'aide japonaise, le Fengtian peut se forger un avenir prospère et une machine de guerre puissante !"
#Mantetsu Collaboration Section
FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration:0 "Cooperation de la Mantetsu"
FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration_desc:0 "Mantetsu, également connue sous le nom de " Compagnie des chemins de fer de Mandchourie du Sud ", exerce un énorme contrôle sur notre économie, avec de nombreuses filiales allant des minoteries aux hôpitaux. Son aide sera malheureusement essentielle au développement de la plupart des aspects de notre économie qui nécessitent une expertise technique japonaise."
FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses:0 "La filiale hôtelière Yamato"
FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses_desc:0 "L'une des entreprises les plus prospères de la Mantetsu en Mandchourie est sa filiale hôtelière Yamato, qui a pour mission de servir les nombreux hommes d'affaires japonais qui se rendent et reviennent chaque jour du Japon. Malgré l'influence indésirable qu'ils exercent, leurs compétences et leur capital sont cruciaux."
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative:0 "Le projet pour l'agriculture du soja"
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative_desc:0 "La minorité coréenne importante du Fengtian est constituée de planteurs de riz qualifiés, mais le soja est devenu une denrée extrêmement recherchée, car il fournit non seulement une excellente source de nourriture, d'engrais et d'aliments pour animaux, mais aussi d'huile de soja dont les usages sont industriels. La Mantetsu a entrepris un effort pour former les Coréens à la culture du soja, mais la réponse a été mitigée. Ils veulent maintenant que nous les aidions à faire adopter ce projet."
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise:0 "Expertise Japonaise en Électricité"
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise_desc:0 "En raison du retard de la Chine au cours du siècle dernier et du chaos des deux dernières décennies, le pays compte peu d'ingénieurs autochtones. L'aide japonaise sera essentielle pour apporter la modernité au Nord-Est."
FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing:0 "Laboratoire de Recherche de la Mantetsu"
FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing_desc:0 "La section de recherche de la Mantetsu, connue sous le nom de " Mantetsu Chōsabu ", est la pièce maîtresse du programme colonial du Japon et poursuit un large éventail d'objectifs scientifiques. Son financement massif et sa réserve de talents pourraient nous être d'une grande utilité dans nos propres efforts."
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects:0 "Projets de génie civil de la Mantetsu"
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects_desc:0 "Si les Japonais ont beaucoup à gagner directement des grands projets de génie civil au Fengtian, ils le font aussi indirectement en aidant à présenter notre régime comme une réussite dans l'amélioration de la vie quotidienne des citoyens. À cet égard, nos intérêts sont mutuellement alignés."
#Crossover Section
FNG_Manufacture_Minsheng:0 "Fabrication Minsheng"
FNG_Manufacture_Minsheng_desc:0 "Fin 1931, le fils de Zhang Zuolin, Xueliang, a chargé un ingénieur américain de créer le premier véhicule automobile de Chine, appelé " Minsheng " ou " moyen de subsistance pour la population ". Craignant la concurrence de leurs propres véhicules, les Japonais ont fait des efforts pour interrompre et faire échouer la production de masse, mais maintenant après de nombreuses années, les pièces sont finalement de nouveau disponible."
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals:0 "Société de Fengtian pour les Métaux Légers"
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals_desc:0 "D'importants gisements de bauxite et d'alunite sont connus depuis de nombreuses années à Liaoning, mais les progrès récents des laboratoires parrainés par la Mantetsu à Fushun et Tokyo ont permis la production d'aluminium par un certain nombre de procédés électrochimiques."
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroélectricité de Yalu et Songhua"
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Les abondants gisements de charbon de Mandchourie constituent une excellente source d'énergie, mais les forts courants des rivières Yalu et Songhua pourraient fournir de l'énergie supplémentaire à peu de frais. Grâce à l'expertise japonaise, nous pourrions exploiter ces puissantes rivières pour alimenter davantage de foyers et d'industries."
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods:0 "Méthodes japonaises de gazéification du charbon"
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc:0 "La quête japonaise de pétrole l'a conduit en Mandchourie, mais aujourd'hui, avec des résultats de prospection décevants, la gazéification du charbon semble la seule voie logique à suivre. Bien que gourmands en énergie, les énormes gisements de charbon de Fushun pourraient rendre ces procédés complexes rentables."
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities:0 "Villes modèles de Mandchourie"
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities_desc:0 "Le Japon se donne parfois du mal pour dépeindre son rôle au Fengtian comme celui d'un père bienveillant, et c'est pourquoi la Mantetsu prévoit d'installer des systèmes électriques, d'égouts et de tramways ultramodernes dans les principales villes de Shenyang, Changchun et Harbin."
#Industrial Development Committee Section
FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC:0 "Fonder la CDI Nord-Est"
FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC_desc:0 "Sur recommandation du Japon, il a été proposé de regrouper plusieurs hommes d'affaires et hommes politiques influents au sein d'un organe appelé " Commission pour le Développement Industriel du Nord-Est " qui pourrait guider le développement industriel de Fengtian."
FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines:0 "Agrandir les mines d'Anshan"
FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines_desc:0 "Les énormes gisements de fer d'Anshan ont été décrits comme étant d'une " importance mondiale " et produisent près de 7 millions de tonnes de fer, avec la possibilité de tripler la production d'ici 1942. Cette expansion devrait permettre à Anshan de devenir l'un des plus grands centres industriels d'Asie Orientale."
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone:0 "Établir la zone industrielle de Jinzhou"
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone_desc:0 "Les docks de Jinzhou et sa position stratégique dans le " corridor Liaoxi ", qui relie le transport terrestre entre le nord et le nord-est de la Chine, en font une cible privilégiée du développement encouragé par le gouvernement. Reste à savoir si des règles particulières seront appliquées à cette zone en faveur des entreprises chinoises ou japonaises."
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines:0 "Agrandir les mines de Fushun"
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines_desc:0 "Les mines autour de Fushun produisent près de 11 millions de tonnes de charbon par an, et les gisements promettent de produire plus de 4,5 milliards de tonnes au total. Alors que certains trains et navires modernes en Occident utilisent du pétrole, l'Empire japonais fonctionne au charbon, et l'importance stratégique de ces mines ne peut être sous-estimée."
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development:0 "Développement commercial de Yingkou"
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc:0 "La ville portuaire de Yingkou est la principale porte d'entrée de Fengtian sur le monde et le deuxième plus grand port du golfe de Bohai après Dalian, sous contrôle japonais. L'énorme augmentation de la production de matériaux à Fengtian exige un investissement tout aussi important dans l'infrastructure commerciale."
#Develop the Nine Provinces Section
FNG_Develop_the_Nine_Provinces:0 "Développer les Neuf Provinces"
FNG_Develop_the_Nine_Provinces_desc:0 "Les Neuf Provinces de Mandchourie, séparées des trois provinces d'origine, contiennent déjà plus de 30 % des chemins de fer chinois et disposent d'une industrie lourde relativement répandue, mais si Fengtian veut aller de l'avant, il faudra les développer et les améliorer. Dans l'idéal, cela devrait être réalisé uniquement par le peuple chinois, mais la réalité impose que les Japonais nous montrent la voie à suivre."
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC:0 "Réorganiser le CNT"
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC_desc:0 "Fondée par le gouvernement Fengtian peu après sa création, la Commission Nationale des Transports sert de conseil de planification pour la construction d'infrastructures à travers le pays. Les Japonais prétendent que son but premier est de perturber les opérations de la Mantetsu, et il y a peut-être au moins une part de vérité dans cette affirmation."
#Resume the Wang Yongjiang Reforms Section
FNG_Resume_the_Wang_Yongjiang_Reforms:0 "Reprendre les réformes de Wang Yongjiang"
FNG_Resume_the_Wang_Yongjiang_Reforms_desc:0 "Le ministre des finances de Zhang Zuolin, Wang Yongjiang, a été pendant de nombreuses années le seul responsable du développement de la Mandchourie d'une région frontalière pauvre à une des régions les plus prospères de Chine. Malheureusement, il nous a été enlevé il y a quelques années, mais son travail et sa vision perdurent."
FNG_Reform_the_Civil_Service_Examination:0 "Réforme de l'Examen de la Fonction Publique"
FNG_Reform_the_Civil_Service_Examination_desc:0 "Utilisé depuis plus de 2 000 ans, l'examen du Service Publique Impérial n'a connu qu'une réforme mineure pendant les dernières années de la dynastie Qing, et a désespérément besoin d'être révisé afin de former une administration compétente et moderne pour Fengtian."
FNG_Centralize_the_Banks:0 "Centraliser les banques"
FNG_Centralize_the_Banks_desc:0 "Fengtian compte actuellement quatre banques émettrices de billets, à savoir la Banque des trois provinces de l'Est, la Banque de Kirin, la Banque de Heilungkiang et la Frontier Bank, qui sont toutes issues d'efforts de centralisation antérieurs. Il semble maintenant pertinent d'achever ce processus et de les unifier sous l'égide d'une banque centrale unique."
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar:0 "Réintroduire le dollar de Fengtian"
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar_desc:0 "Le dollar de Fengtian a été l'une des expériences ultérieures de Wang Yongjiang, et a servi de monnaie non adossée à l'argent mais toujours payable en impôts, démontrant la foi du gouvernement dans sa valeur mais ne nécessitant pas d'argent supplémentaire pour l'imprimer. Après les énormes dépenses gouvernementales pendant les guerres civiles et l'inflation qui s'en est suivie, la monnaie a été abandonnée, mais sa flexibilité pourrait nous être utile aujourd'hui."
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies:0 "Soutenir les sociétés mixtes sino-japonaises"
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc:0 "Un grand nombre d'entreprises de Fengtian offrent des actions à la fois aux Chinois et aux Japonais, y compris l'infâme Mantetsu, mais relativement peu de Chinois ont les fonds nécessaires pour investir et, par conséquent, la plupart des sociétés mixtes sont à majorité japonaise. Le soutien du gouvernement pourrait nous permettre de fournir des moyens et des avantages à nos compatriotes Chinois et de modifier progressivement cet équilibre."
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment:0 "Encourager l'investissement chinois"
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment_desc:0 "L'investissement chinois est au cœur de nos efforts pour rendre au moins une partie du contrôle de l'économie de Fengtian à son peuple, au lieu de la Mantetsu. Des mesures incitatives et une planification minutieuse sont la seule façon d'aller de l'avant."
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve:0 "Remplir la réserve d'argent"
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve_desc:0 "Le yuan de Fengtian, notre principale devise, est soutenu par l'argent et a même gagné de la valeur contre le yen japonais dans le passé. Les Japonais ont répondu à cette tendance en insistant sur le fait que nos réserves n'ont jamais détenu suffisamment d'argent pour soutenir correctement la monnaie. Malheureusement, il se peut qu'il y ait eu une part de vérité à ce sujet, et il faut donc acheter plus d'argent si nous voulons attirer des investissements supplémentaires."
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment:0 "Encourager l'investissement japonais"
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment_desc:0 "Malheureusement, les capitaux étrangers sont cruciaux pour nos efforts de développement et nous devons donc tenter d'attirer les investisseurs japonais aux côtés des investisseurs chinois. Bien qu'ils ne recevront pas les mêmes encouragements que nos propres citoyens, ils devraient être mis en confiance par le récent remplissage de nos réserves d'argent."
#Political Branch
FNG_Courting_the_Grand_Marshals_Favour:0 "Solliciter la faveur du Grand Maréchal"
FNG_Courting_the_Grand_Marshals_Favour_desc:0 "Le gouvernement de Fengtian se compose de plusieurs groupes qui se disputent l'attention et les faveurs du Grand Maréchal, autour duquel gravitent la plupart des fonctions de l'État. La Clique des communications et d'autres membres de l'assemblée réclament une constitution, tandis que les généraux appellent à un retour au pouvoir militaire, mais Zhang pourrait plutôt être en mesure d'apaiser le chaos et de remplacer les factions en conflit par sa propre poigne de fer."
#Warlord Section
FNG_Revise_the_Military_Leadership:0 "Revoir le commandement militaire"
FNG_Revise_the_Military_Leadership_desc:0 "Depuis plusieurs années, le pouvoir militaire est divisé entre les anciennes et les jeunes factions, les membres plus vénérés, les vétérans des guerres civiles et les nouveaux membres formés au Collège de guerre de l'armée japonaise. De graves conflits sont apparus entre eux, et si l'on veut progresser, le Grand Maréchal doit choisir son camp."
FNG_Empower_the_Warlords:0 "Renforcer les Seigneurs de Guerre"
FNG_Empower_the_Warlords_desc:0 "Jusqu'à la fondation de la République, Zhang Zuolin n'avait jamais eu le contrôle total des quatre provinces. Au lieu de cela, il a exercé son hégémonie sur une série de seigneurs de guerre plus faibles, qui ont ensuite été intégrés au nouveau gouvernement grâce à une campagne de centralisation soutenue par le Japon. Ces seigneurs de guerre servent maintenant comme généraux de Zhang à travers une structure de direction semi-féodale, mais leurs propres ambitions demeurent."
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best:0 "Les généraux sont les mieux placés"
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best_desc:0 "Les politiciens corrompus de l'Assemblée ont laissé Fengtian errer sans but pendant trop longtemps. Seuls le Grand Maréchal et ses généraux sont capables de faire avancer le pays. Il faut la volonté de fer des militaires disciplinés pour résister aux tentations des Japonais et des autres forces qui cherchent à diviser et à affaiblir la Chine !"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident:0 "L'incident de Jilin"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident_desc:0 "Il est devenu évident que le fossé entre les factions de la Vieille et de la Jeune Garde n'a fait que se creuser suite à leur récente accession au pouvoir. Des agents loyaux envers le gouvernement ont déterminé qu'une des factions est en train de procéder à un déploiement militaire inattendu devant Songyuan, dans la province de Jilin. Cela mérite une enquête, et éventuellement une action décisive."
FNG_Establish_the_Supreme_War_Council:0 "Établir le Conseil de Guerre Suprême"
FNG_Establish_the_Supreme_War_Council_desc:0 "Une fois les militaires unifiés et tous les obstacles politiques éliminés, le moment est venu de mettre sur pied un Conseil de Guerre Suprême afin de jeter les fondements de la prospérité et de l'essor de la Chine. Avec ce conseil de puissants généraux à notre tête, le gouvernement de Fengtian sera invincible !"
#Cult of Personality Section
FNG_A_Father_to_the_People:0 "Un Père pour le Peuple"
FNG_A_Father_to_the_People_desc:0 "Dans le cadre des efforts de centralisation déployés au cours de la dernière décennie, Zhang Zuolin a été présenté par le gouvernement comme une figure paternelle bienveillante qui protège le peuple chinois du conservatisme rétrograde des Qing et des influences impérialistes occidentales. La poursuite de cet effort ne peut que renforcer notre légitimité."
FNG_Exalt_the_Grand_Marshal:0 "Elever Grand Maréchal"
FNG_Exalt_the_Grand_Marshal_desc:0 "Les généraux et les politiciens se chamaillent sans fin, et il est devenu clair qu'aucun progrès ne peut être fait dans l'ombre de leur direction incompétente. Le peuple et l'État ont besoin de conseils qui ne peuvent provenir que d'une seule source. Élevons le Grand Maréchal Zhang !"
FNG_Formalize_the_Cult_of_Personality:0 "Entériner le culte de la personnalité"
FNG_Formalize_the_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0 "Nous devons redoubler d'efforts pour présenter à juste titre notre glorieux dirigeant comme l'homme qu'il est vraiment, un modèle et un exemple pour tous les Chinois. Les fonctions officielles de l'État et les efforts de propagande seront adaptés en conséquence."
FNG_Proclaim_a_New_Mandate:0 "Proclamer un nouveau mandat"
FNG_Proclaim_a_New_Mandate_desc:0 "La détermination du peuple à mettre fin à la  décadence des Qing et aux influences impérialistes occidentales n'a jamais été aussi forte, comme en témoigne la proclamation faite aujourd'hui par le Grand Maréchal de réduire les pouvoirs de l'Assemblée, qui a longtemps été infestée de traîtres."
FNG_There_is_only_the_Grand_Marshal:0 "Il n'y a que le Grand Maréchal"
FNG_There_is_only_the_Grand_Marshal_desc:0 "Il est temps pour le Grand Maréchal, soleil du futur de la Chine et père bien-aimé du peuple chinois, d'éliminer les forces perturbatrices internes et d'unir le pays sous une seule bannière ! Dix mille ans au Grand Maréchal Zhang !"
#Constitutional Section
FNG_Reorganize_the_Legislative_Polity:0 "Réorganiser le Pouvoir Législatif"
FNG_Reorganize_the_Legislative_Polity_desc:0 "L'Assemblée, bâtie sur les cendres du gouvernement de Beiyang et d'autres groupes d'exilés du Sud, est restée divisée et largement impuissante depuis sa création. Ses différentes factions s'efforcent d'attirer les faveurs du Grand Maréchal, et de se forger ainsi une place plus importante dans le jeu politique."
FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly:0 "Faire confiance à l'Assemblée"
FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly_desc:0 "Depuis la révolution Xinhai, il y a près de deux décennies, aucun gouvernement démocratique en Chine n'a réussi à rédiger et à adopter une constitution, et afin d'obtenir le plein soutien du peuple dans nos efforts pour reprendre le Sud, nous devons confier à l'Assemblée cette tâche importante."
FNG_The_Autumn_Program:0 "Le Programme d'Automne"
FNG_The_Autumn_Program_desc:0 "Après les négociations de l'automne dernier, les membres influents de la Ligue pour la Reconquête, de la Clique des Communications et de la Clique de Zhang ont établi un programme décrivant leur intention de rédiger une Constitution. L'un des points clés de cette collaboration est la compréhension partagée que, sans de telles mesures, le gouvernement risque de s'égarer et n'obtiendra jamais le véritable soutien du peuple chinois."
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention:0 "La Convention de Harbin"
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention_desc:0 "Une constitution efficace ne pourra voir le jour qu'à l'issue d'une convention réunissant tous les principaux partis, et il va sans dire que certains peuvent tenter de perturber les débats. La ville de Harbin a été choisie pour accueillir la convention, étant donné sa longue histoire en tant que centre multiethnique."
FNG_A_Resplendent_Republic:0 "Une République Resplendissante"
FNG_A_Resplendent_Republic_desc:0 "Avec la création d'une constitution satisfaisant au moins les principaux acteurs restants au sein du gouvernement, il ne reste plus qu'à la faire adopter par l'Assemblée.

#Strengthen the Army Branch
FNG_Strengthen_the_Army:0 "Renforcer l'armée"
FNG_Strengthen_the_Army_desc:0 "Pendant les guerres civiles, l'armée de Fengtian a été complètement décimée à la suite de combats intenses contre des matériels allemands plus modernes et de défections par des généraux importants, et les huit années suivantes ont vu un réarmement lent mais constant et une réorganisation au diapason de la reprise économique."
#Shenyang National Academy Section
FNG_Found_the_Shenyang_National_Academy:0 "Fonder l'Académie Nationale de Shenyang"
FNG_Found_the_Shenyang_National_Academy_desc:0 "L'augmentation de l'influence japonaise dans le Nord-Est après les guerres civiles a entraîné la fermeture de l'ancienne Académie militaire des trois provinces de l'Est, les recrues étant maintenant envoyées au Japon pour y recevoir une éducation à un coût presque inabordable. En conséquence, et aussi sous la pression extérieure, nous avons accepté des officiers japonais dans nos rangs inférieurs. Cela doit cesser."
FNG_Expel_Japanese_Officers:0 "Expulser les officiers japonais"
FNG_Expel_Japanese_Officers_desc:0 "L'influence du Japon sur nos militaires est inacceptable, nous devons expulser leurs officiers de nos rangs. Le coût d'une telle mesure sans un nombre suffisant de remplaçants pourrait être très élevé, sans parler des contrecoups diplomatiques, et nous devons donc agir avec prudence."
#Japanese Instruction Column
FNG_Obtain_Japanese_Instructors:0 "Obtenir des instructeurs japonais"
FNG_Obtain_Japanese_Instructors_desc:0 "Les Japonais disposent d'une armée moderne comparable en force et en discipline à toutes celles de l'Occident. Étant donné que le gouvernement japonais est prêt à fournir des instructeurs gratuitement, nous devrions profiter de cette occasion pour construire une armée que les Qing nous envieront."
FNG_Modernized_Curriculum:0 "Programme d'études modernisé"
FNG_Modernized_Curriculum_desc:0 "Le programme d'études moderne japonais a été conçu pour contrer l'agression russe dans les plaines de Mandchourie. Il met l'accent sur les facteurs de moral et l'obstination, en se concentrant sur un entraînement destiné à développer la capacité à repérer des occasions d'attaques décisives, d'enveloppement des flancs ennemis exposés, et des formations d'encerclement, pour, de la sorte, détruire des forces numériquement et technologiquement supérieures."
FNG_Moral_Indoctrination:0 "Endoctrinement moral"
FNG_Moral_Indoctrination_desc:0 "La formation japonaise souligne l'importance du facteur humain dans le maintien d'une offensive continue, avec la conviction que l'esprit peut triompher de l'acier. Cela exige un endoctrinement moral sérieux."

FNG_Lessons_from_the_Civil_War:0 "Leçons de la Guerre Civile"
FNG_Lessons_from_the_Civil_War_desc:0 "La phase la plus récente des guerres civiles a vu les troupes de Fengtian combattre des ennemis dont les armes et la technologie surpassaient de loin les leurs. A travers des épreuves du feu et du sang, des armes improvisées et des méthodes inhabituelles ont émergé pour s'adapter au nouvel environnement, permettant aux soldats de Fengtian de frapper un grand coup."
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty:0 "Liens de fidélité"
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty_desc:0 "La structure de direction de l'Armée de terre est pratiquement féodale, et la plupart de nos généraux et de nos troupes doivent leur loyauté personnelle au Grand Maréchal, plutôt qu'à un concept abstrait d'État. Cela a ses inconvénients évidentes, mais le renforcement de ces liens aidera à résister à l'ingérence japonaise."

La grande majorité de ses navires sont obsolètes, datant de l'ère de la Marine de Guangxu Beiyang, et le moral est bas parmi les marins."
FNG_Reorganize_the_Coastal_Defence_Forces:0 "Réorganiser les forces de défense côtière"
FNG_Reorganize_the_Coastal_Defence_Forces_desc:0 "Parce que la marine de Fengtian n'a aucun moyen réaliste de s'opposer à la marine plus grande et plus moderne déployée par Qing, son but principal est la défense côtière. Compte tenu des récentes et inquiétantes défaillances, telles que la vente d'armements sur le marché noir par l'équipage d'un navire, une réorganisation et une réforme importantes sont nécessaires."
FNG_Expand_Yingkou_Naval_Yard:0 "Agrandissement du chantier naval de Yingkou"
FNG_Expand_Yingkou_Naval_Yard_desc:0 "Yingkou est le deuxième plus grand port de la région du Nord-Est, après le port japonais de Dalian, et le port d'attache de notre marine. L'agrandissement du chantier naval de Yingkou est une première étape essentielle si nous voulons entreprendre un projet de reconstruction navale important."
FNG_The_Nine_Points_Strategy:0 "La stratégie des Neuf Points"
FNG_The_Nine_Points_Strategy_desc:0 "La forte asymétrie de forces entre les marines de Fengtian et Qing signifie qu'en l'absence de soutien japonais, l'ensemble de notre côte risque d'être envahie. Les stratèges japonais ont défini neuf positions où les débarquements navals sont les plus probables et ont rédigé des plans pour leur défense."
FNG_Regular_River_Patrols:0 "Patrouilles fluviales régulières"
FNG_Regular_River_Patrols_desc:0 "La marine possède un certain nombre de petits bateaux de patrouille, parfois utilisés pour surveiller les rivières Yalu et Songhua, mais la majorité d'entre eux sont en train de rouiller dans les entrepôts. Ils pourraient être mieux utilisés pour former nos équipages et maintenir notre sécurité interne, si nous pouvons trouver les fonds nécessaires."

FNG_The_China_Flying_Corps_desc:0 "Organisé à l'origine par le fils du Grand Maréchal, Zhang Xueliang, l'armée de l'air s'est bien comportée lors de la dernière guerre, ne perdant sa supériorité aérienne qu'avec l'arrivée d'avions plus modernes pilotés par les Allemands. Depuis lors, elle s'est agrandie, mais conserve des avions avec des décennies de retard sur les normes occidentales."
FNG_Order_New_Aircraft:0 "Commander de nouveaux avions"
FNG_Order_New_Aircraft_desc:0 "La conception d'un véritable avion nécessite des ingénieurs bien formés et extrêmement spécialisés, ce à quoi nous n'avons malheureusement pas accès. Par conséquent, afin d'améliorer notre force aérienne, nous devons en commander davantage au Japon."

FNG_Japanese_Instruction:0 "Instructeurs Japonais"
FNG_Japanese_Instruction_desc:0 "Les énormes progrès réalisés dans la conception des avions au cours des deux dernières décennies se sont traduits par des avions qui volent presque complètement différemment de leurs prédécesseurs, nécessitant des réévaluations totales des manœuvres et tactiques de vol pour nos nouveaux avions. Les instructeurs japonais sont la seule réponse efficace à ce problème."

FNG_National_Irredentism_desc:0 "La fin des guerres civiles en 1928 a vu la fondation du Gouvernement de Fengtian, mais ce qui aurait normalement dû être un moment de célébration a en fait représenté l'exil du mouvement républicain autrefois florissant dans le nord-est de la Chine. Le Sud doit être et sera reconquis!"
FNG_The_Yanshan_Plan:0 "Le plan Yanshan"
FNG_The_Yanshan_Plan_desc:0 "La stratégie la plus simple et la plus réaliste pour reconquérir le Sud implique un assaut à travers la province de Jehol et à travers les montagnes de Yan au Sud. Le col de Shanhaiguan étant si étroit, les troupes de montagne doivent être entraînées et équipées pour élargir le front."
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria:0 "Fortifier la Manchourie"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_desc:0 "Les montagnes du Yan au sud, la chaîne du Petit Khigan à l'ouest et le golfe Bohai à l'est créent une forteresse naturelle autour de la plaine mandchoue, laissant le col Shanhai comme seul point d'entrée facile. Les fortifications artificielles pourrait rendre la Mandchourie pratiquement impénétrable."

FNG_Wu_Wang_Zai_Ju_desc:0 "L'ancien idiome chinois " N'oubliez pas ce qui s'est passé à Ju " fait allusion à la défense désespérée de Ju, l'état du dernier bastion de Qi, d'où il a mené avec succès une campagne pour reconquérir tout son territoire perdu. La Mandchourie sera notre Ju, d'où nous allons reconquérir toute la Chine !"
FNG_Jehol_Border_Exercises:0 "Exercices à la frontière de Jehol"
FNG_Jehol_Border_Exercises_desc:0 "Les exercices frontaliers non seulement renforcent la discipline et l'entraînement, mais ils permettent aussi à nos troupes d'avoir une connaissance intime du terrain sur lequel elles pourraient bientôt combattre. Par conséquent, si nous sommes poussés sur la défensive, ils peuvent exécuter plus efficacement leurs tactiques et faire appel à l'appui-feu avec une extrême précision, car ils connaissent le terrain."

FNG_Golden_Dragon_Cigarettes_desc:0 "Une variante de la déjà populaire cigarette " Chauve-souris d'Or ", la cigarette Dragon d'Or pourrait être un moyen efficace de répandre la dépendance par l'infusion de quantités infimes d'opium. Tout ce dont Doihara a besoin, c'est qu'on l'appel."
FNG_Shanhaiguan_Infiltration:0 "Infiltration de Shanhaiguan"
FNG_Shanhaiguan_Infiltration_desc:0 "Avec la frontière Qing-Fengtian montagneuse et fortement militarisée, même une attaque à Shanhaiguan sera difficile. Certains ont proposé que nous puissions faciliter notre entrée en infiltrant des unités, qui se relèveront une fois la guerre commencée, et en attaquant les défenseurs Qing par l'arrière."
FNG_Escalate_the_Propaganda_War:0 "Intensifier la guerre de propagande"
FNG_Escalate_the_Propaganda_War_desc:0 "Fengtian et Qing ont soutenu une guerre de propagande intermittente au cours des huit dernières années. En raison de la nature persistante et souvent exagérée des menaces de part et d'autre et de leur incapacité constante à se développer bien au-delà des mots, la communauté internationale au sens large a cessé de les prendre très au sérieux."

FNG_Retake_Chahar_desc:0 "Dans les derniers mois de la dernière guerre civile, le baron fou de Mongolie s'est injustement emparé du Chahar, notre terre légitime. Nous nous efforcerions de le reprendre, mais von-Sternberg semble peu susceptible de mener une guerre limitée, et nos intérêts se situent au sud. Nous pouvons peut-être trouver un moment opportun pour frapper."

fengtian.1.t:0 "La décision de Zhang Zuolin"
fengtian.1.d:0 "Pendant des années, nous nous sommes courbés sous le poids du contrôle japonais. L'empereur Qing, Pu Yi, a été un ami et si les choses s'étaient passées différemment, nous aurions pu le soutenir dans son ascension. Maintenant, les Japonais l'attaquent et malgré leur promesse de l'écraser rapidement et sans effort, ses troupes sont sur notre territoire. Nous devons prendre une décision concernant notre avenir !"

### New Fengtian Events ###
fengtian.new.0.t:0 "Warning!"
fengtian.new.0.d:0 "This is a public service announcement:\n\nPlease be aware that China, in its current state, is an atrocious broken mess. It is not recommended that you play any faction in China outside the Northeast (Fengtian), and if you choose to do so you proceed 'at your own risk'. We apologise for the mess, and order should be restored once the China Rework is finally complete."
fengtian.new.0.a:0 "Understood."
fengtian.new.1.t:0 "Huanghanhui Crackdown"
fengtian.new.1.d:0 "The Huanghanhui, or Imperial Han Society, has been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."
fengtian.new.1.a:0 "Troubling."
fengtian.new.2.t:0 "Communications Clique Leads Railroad Strikes"
fengtian.new.2.d:0 "The Communications Clique, with its widespread influence in Chinese-owned Manchurian railroads like the CER, has resorted to encouraging union activity and strikes to compensate for its recent losses of influence in government. The Clique will likely only go so far, for risk of creating something it cannot control, but their methods have already been fairly successful in demonstrating their political and economic clout."
fengtian.new.2.a:0 "Unfortunate but necessary."
#Land Reform Events
fengtian.new.3.t:0 "Land Disputes in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.new.3.d:0 "As a product of various socio-economic changes, such as the steady shift of seasonal workers from the agricultural north to industrial jobs in Fengtian Province, land disputes have begun to flare up at an alarming rate. Normally these matters would be handled by the local Xiangshen, landlords, retired officials, clan elders, and scholars who 'represent' peasants in meetings with county officials. On this occasion, however, a large collection of peasants have bypassed local authorities and are attempting to petition the government directly. Normally such a petition, unworthy of the central government's attention, would be brushed aside, but unfortunately the situation has attracted the attention of the Asahi Shimbun, a leftist Japanese newspaper.\n\nThe local Xiangshen, believing this matter to be solely within their jurisdiction, request that they be allowed to settle the matter themselves, refuting accusations of favouritism and corruption by the peasants. On the one hand, throughout all of Chinese history the Central Government has never truly been able to exert influence over the Xiangshen, but on the other the peasants grow increasingly desperate, and the entire region is watching."
fengtian.new.3.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen."
fengtian.new.3.b:0 "Support Local Land Reform."
fengtian.new.4.t:0 "Clamour for Further Land Reform"
fengtian.new.4.d:0 "Despite the government's efforts to resolve the land disputes in the north, the matter has again arisen, the farmers likely emboldened by their predecessors and the publicity they received. The situation is fairly similar, as the Xiangshen once again assert their authority, and the peasants demand increased control over their land and what happens on it.\n\nThis petition, however, has double the signatures, and with the results of the last case fresh in their minds, other farmers begin to grumble."
fengtian.new.4.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen."

fengtian.new.5.d:0 "It is unusual for members of the Recovery League to stray far from their usual statements about southern reclamation, or from the scripts prepared for them by deep-pocketed 'friends', but some more liberal minded members of the Assembly have received a landslide of peasant petitions regarding land reform, and have decided to champion their cause. They argue that if our republican government aims to truly embody the values of the Xinhai Revolution and to differentiate itself from the archaic Qing, it must satisfy the needs of the common people, and strip away the sort of feudalism that the Xiangshen represent.\n\nThis group of vocal politicians remains a minority amid an otherwise indifferent Assembly, and advisers warn that the Xiangshen as a whole are not to be trifled with, but this decision ultimately lies in the Marshal's hands."

#Land Reform Event Conclusions
fengtian.new.6.t:0 "Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.6.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavour, unsatisfied peasants rose up in several northern villages, only to be put down by local garrisons. To add to the sad and embarrassing situation, the commander of a nearby Japanese brigade patrolling the Russian border decided to intervene, adding the impression that foreign influence was behind the crackdown, and that the central government is incapable of keeping order without outside assistance.\n\nThis situation might have been handled better."
fengtian.new.6.a:0 "Damnable peasants!"
fengtian.new.7.t:0 "Widespread Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.7.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavour, unsatisfied peasants rose up across the north, overwhelming local garrisons and posing a threat to to the regional command at Qihihar. Fortunately the lightly armed farmers were poorly organised, lacking any kind of leadership structure, and so upon the full deployment of the regional general's forces, the attackers were dispersed and many slaughtered.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the loose discipline of the troops turned mere securing of towns into a looting frenzy, which was soon joined by nearby Japanese troops who apparently felt themselves 'under threat'. Our soldiers have been disciplined, but the damage has been done, and it is difficult to understate the current ill-will held toward the central government. The Xiangshen, smugly assured of their correctness all along, are happy to wait before re-asserting their authority to let the pain and embarrassment fully sink in."
fengtian.new.7.a:0 "What a disaster!"
fengtian.new.8.t:0 "Land Reform Underway"
fengtian.new.8.d:0 "For better or worse, land reform is now underway at both the local and national levels, with officials superseding the local Xiangshen to assert the central government's sovereignty for the first time in hundreds of years. However, while they have used that time to thoroughly game the machine of local administration, they were also its designers and engineers, forcing officials to proverbially re-invent the wheel. While many are satisfied, the economy is certain to suffer considerably, and it is unclear just how far the reforms will be able to go."
fengtian.new.8.a:0 "This is the price of progress."
#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling
fengtian.new.9.t:0 "The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling"
fengtian.new.9.d:0 "Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At the Japanese government's behest, these schools were more recently opened to the paying public, clearly as part of an attempt to spread Japanese culture and norms. However, the schools are crucial to education, not only because many children of Fengtian's wealthy are enrolled, but also because they provide their services at no government cost.\n\nAny attempt to close the Mantetsu schools to the public will be met not only with Japanese outrage, but a state of educational chaos as we try to pick up the slack. While the civil service has undergone reforms, it remains questionable as to whether our economy and domestic educational staff will be up to the challenge."
fengtian.new.9.a:0 "Close the schools."
fengtian.new.9.b:0 "There is no choice."
fengtian.new.10.t:0 "The Kimono Scandal"
fengtian.new.10.d:0 "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutou Kunitachidaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged.\n\nThere is little question, however, that the Qing will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
fengtian.new.10.a:0 "What an embarrassment!"
fengtian.new.10.b:0 "Close the Mantetsu schools!"
fengtian.new.11.t:0 "Students Join the Youth League"
fengtian.new.11.d:0 "In an embarrassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many, and invited outright enmity toward themselves and the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."
fengtian.new.11.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
fengtian.new.11.b:0 "Close the schools!"
fengtian.new.12.t:0 "Chinese Uniforms for Chinese Students"
fengtian.new.12.d:0 "After some time and effort, as well as considerable expense, several new Chinese-run schools have pooled their resources to produce a new standard uniform for our students.

The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays in construction due to the eruption of war in the south, and concerted Japanese attempts to stall it. The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThese companies, in the abscence of Mantetsu and Japanese engineers, will do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."

While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."

fengtian.new.15.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.new.16.t:0 "The Changchun-Dailai Line is Complete"

Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway."
fengtian.new.17.d_jap:0 "The final of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line, which like other recent works, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway, theoretically keeping Mantetsu's creeping influence further from its operations. All the same, Mantetsu offers to construct the railroad, likely hoping to salvage at least something from the situation."

fengtian.new.19.t:0 "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
fengtian.new.19.d:0 "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight.\n\nWhile this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves. The strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
fengtian.new.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
fengtian.new.20.t:0 "Delays Plague Railway Construction"
fengtian.new.20.d:0 "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments unaccountably missing, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labour force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals'; inspections which inevitably required the suspension of work.\n\nThese same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit Chinese construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do."
fengtian.new.20.a:0 "Frustrating."
fengtian.new.21.t:0 "Delays Plague Mantetsu Railway Construction"
fengtian.new.21.d:0 "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive.\n\nThe local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."

Korean farmers, who make up the majority of immigrants to Manchuria, are excellent rice planters, and in addition to many Chinese prefer to plant crops they have more experience with instead of Soy.\n\nIn an attempt to change this, Mantetsu began the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a plan intending to educate farmers and incentivise the production of soy as a cash crop, but it has so far been poorly received.

fengtian.new.47.d:0 "A representative from Mantetsu's Research Wing has come forward with a proposal, the acceptance of which he assures the government is in its best interest, but which he insists must be kept completely secret. Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with relevant expertise in order to lead an initiative with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in Fengtian. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway.\n\nAfter some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts for unclear reasons, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic roles have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."

General Kekichi Ueda himself is said to have stormed into the office of the Mantetsu president, Yosuke Matsuoka, and delivered a thunderous verbal barrage regarding the necessity to keep Fengtian dependent upon Japanese aid. The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved.

fengtian.new.52.t:0 "The Public is Incensed!"

fengtian.new.53.t:0 "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.new.53.d:0 "After decades of decline and destitution, the necessity of progress and development has never been more glaring, but still most reforms are overshadowed by the spectres of discontent, disorder, and dissent. Still, stagnation bears as much risk as change, and the South will never be reclaimed without it.\n\nThus the task falls to the government to answer calls to 'Enrich the Country and Strengthen the Army', but limited resources force us to prioritise one or the other."
fengtian.new.53.a:0 "We must enrich the Country!"
fengtian.new.53.b:0 "We must strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.new.53.c:0 "Tell me more about the state of the Economy."
fengtian.new.53.e:0 "Tell me more about the state of the Army."

fengtian.new.54.t:0 "Enrich the Country"
fengtian.new.54.d:0 "While Manchuria's resources are rich and diverse, and Fengtian stands as the third greatest industrial centre in East Asia, its economy remains plagued by a number of structural problems, the symptoms of which cripple the state and slow progress toward Southern Reclamation. Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society.\n\nWhile the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals.\n\nIt should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to the Qing, they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."
fengtian.new.54.a:0 "Let us enrich the country!"
fengtian.new.54.b:0 "Perhaps the Army is more important?"

fengtian.new.55.t:0 "Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.new.55.d:0 "The Fengtian Army, officially the Army of the Republic, is an impressive sight by most Chinese standards, though pales in comparison to most foreign forces, and has only recently recovered much of its strength after its decimation in the Civil Wars. The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the Civil Wars, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard.\n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of the Qing, and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."
fengtian.new.55.a:0 "Let us strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.new.55.b:0 "But what of the economy?"

fengtian.new.56.t:0 "The Nine Provinces"
fengtian.new.56.d:0 "Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Jehol, to the Southwest of Fengtian Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south."
fengtian.new.56.a:0 "Understood."

fengtian.new.57.t:0 "The Wang Yongjiang Reforms"
fengtian.new.57.d:0 "At the start of the 20th century, Manchuria was a poorly managed frontier, fraught by lawlessness and banditry. With the rule of Zhang, however, came rapid reforms through his finance minister Wang Yongjiang. Wang backed his currency, originally no different from those printed by other warlords, with silver, generating confidence and eventually gaining value against the Japanese Yen. Extensive tax reform solved outstanding debts, and by the early 1920s the economy was bolstered by immigrants fleeing instability throughout the rest of China.\n\nOf course, this could not last, and Minister Wang died in 1929. With Fengtian's economy only beginning to recover from eight years of post-war decline, the time has come to implement new reforms, inspired by those of the old, and return the Northeast to its rightful place as one of China's most prosperous regions.\n\nA minister must be chosen to draw up the necessary plans, and determine priorities for government efforts."

fengtian.new.58.t:0 "Yamato Hotel Licenses"
fengtian.new.58.d:0 "Mantetsu's Yamato Hotel line has long been a staple of the South Manchuria Railway Zone; the concessions zone ceded first to Imperial Russia and then to Japan after 1906, and then expanded following the 21 demands of 1915 through a rather loose interpretation of its provisions to include all of southern Manchuria. All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself.\n\nMantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices of Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."
fengtian.new.58.a:0 "Limit construction."
fengtian.new.58.b:0 "Let them build as they please."

fengtian.new.59.t:0 "The Northeast Industrial Development Commission"
fengtian.new.59.d:0 "At Japan's request, and with no particular reason to refuse, we have established a legal and fiscal framework enabling the creation of the Northeast Industrial Development Commission. Serving to oversee and direct the development of Fengtian's industry, mostly through the allocation of funds and leases, the commission now faces the question of its composition.\n\nThe Concordia Association has proposed the inclusion of a series of extremely talented individuals with experience working for the Nissan and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan, who stress the need for an export driven economy taking advantage of Fengtian's existing natural resources, while the Grand Marshal's generals insist upon the necessity of an 'Army First' approach to development, and are using their considerable influence to ensure the placement of military men on the commission. The Communications Clique recommends their own presence, and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast.\n\nUnfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. Additionally, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence. At the same time, the Japanese will not appreciate exclusion."
fengtian.new.59.a:0 "Prioritise exports."
fengtian.new.59.b:0 "The army must come first."
fengtian.new.59.c:0 "A mixed approach is best."

fengtian.new.60.t:0 "Mantetsu Chosabū"
fengtian.new.60.d:0 "The South Manchuria Railway Company's Research Wing, colloquially known as 'Mantetsu Chosabū', has grown over the years from a mere corporate R&D department into the heart of Japan's colonial research programme, with divisions dedicated to everything from agricultural science to intelligence gathering. The sheer scale of Mantetsu Chosabū and its ambitions has lead to the opening of offices in Berlin, Vancouver, and New York, to attract foreign talent, and wide recruitment from Japan's foremost universities. The result is a surprisingly liberal and open minded intellectual community, which sometimes goes insofar as to place scientific inquiry before nationalistic concerns.\n\nThis appears to be one of those instances, as our government has been approached by a Chosabū representative offering future assistance in one of several technological fields, having convinced Kesago Nakajima, the leader of the Japanese Military Mission to Fengtian, that this move will improve our overall prosperity and readiness to defeat the Qing. It should be noted that the Kwantung Army garrison in Dairen were strongly opposed to this arrangement."

fengtian.new.69.t:0 "The Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
fengtian.new.69.d:0 "Jinzhou's convenient location makes it excellent for a proposed Industrial Zone, and several groups have already begun jockeying for a dominant position in development; most notably a Mantetsu subsidiary specialising in canning and light metal work, the Communications Clique who want to establish a rolling stock factory, and the military which insists that the zone must be used for munitions manufacture ahead of 'personal capitalistic gains'. The situation is made somewhat unusual by the Communications Clique, who are usually able to front quite a bit of money, and rumours suggest that several members are under pressure from the military to weaken their own bidding position."
fengtian.new.69.a:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.new.69.b:0 "Choose the Communications Clique."
fengtian.new.69.c:0 "Choose the Zhang Clique."

fengtian.new.70.t:0 "Filling the Silver Reserve"
fengtian.new.70.d:0 "A full silver reserve is crucial to building confidence in Fengtian's currency, and even more crucial to attracting foreign investment, without which Fengtian can never hope to match the Qing to the south who have been, for the past eight years, flush with German capital. However, silver is an expensive commodity, and paying for enough to fill the reserve fully would undoubtedly cut funding from other areas.\n\nSome ministers have secretly suggested only buying about half of the desired quantity, as many believed the reserve was less than full before the Civil Wars, but those rumours were never confirmed despite the significant economic recession that followed the government's inability to settle its war debts.\n\nFilling the reserve inadequately would certainly be a big risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one."
fengtian.new.70.a:0 "Fill the reserve."
fengtian.new.70.b:0 "No risk no reward."

fengtian.new.71.t:0 "Economic Disaster!"
fengtian.new.71.d:0 "After the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, major lenders to our own government, unexpectedly called for outstanding debts to be paid, our Central Bank suddenly found itself unable to provide sufficient silver for the transaction. News of the situation quickly leaked to the public provoking a run on the banks, and widespread financial panic. Rumour suggests that the crisis is not a product of gross mismanagement and incompetence on behalf of the government, which would surprise few in Fengtian, but rather a deliberate move to deceive the public. Mantetsu's offices in Shenyang and Harbin have already begun a full scale investigation, and unless action is taken they seem likely to discover a very incriminating paper trail.\n\nWhile there are several options available, it would be unfortunate if certain government files inexplicably went missing..."
fengtian.new.71.a:0 "Burn the evidence!"
fengtian.new.71.b:0 "Burn it and blame the Japanese!"
fengtian.new.71.c:0 "Ask Japan for a bailout!"
fengtian.new.71.e:0 "We must come clean!"

fengtian.new.72.t:0 "Banking Evidence Discovered!"
fengtian.new.72.d:0 "After a thorough investigation involving untold bribes and threats, Mantetsu investigators have concluded that our government intentionally deceived its people, and is entirely to blame for the recent financial disaster. We are in no position to refuse their calls for the arrests of several involved ministers, but conveniently the Grand Marshal and his closest advisers have been spared direct blame, and Mantetsu's Director Yosuke Matsuoka has suggested that in return for political favours, the entire matter could be shelved indefinitely."
fengtian.new.72.a:0 "Accept the offer."
fengtian.new.72.b:0 "Refuse the offer."

fengtian.new.73.t:0 "Japan Agrees to the Bailout"
fengtian.new.73.d:0 "In a move that will surely save our economy, Japan has agreed to pay for sufficient silver to fill our reserve, and will not look further into the matter. Of course, this was likely inspired by little more than self interest, but some say that Japan may not be so bad after all..."
fengtian.new.73.a:0 "We are saved!"

fengtian.new.74.t:0 "Japan Refuses the Bailout"
fengtian.new.74.d:0 "Despite our pleas, Japan has refused a bailout, leaving us in the same economic position we were before we made the request and with ample humiliation to boot. The only silver lining is that many citizens, even including some employees of Mantetsu, have lost a great deal of faith in Japan's benevolent position toward China."
fengtian.new.74.a:0 "If only that was more than a metaphor."
fengtian.new.74.b:0 "Perhaps Minister Ruan can smooth things over."
fengtian.new.74.c:0 "Perhaps Minister Ding can smoothing things over."

fengtian.new.75.t:0 "The State of the Officer Corps"
fengtian.new.75.d:0 "Fengtian's officer corps is an unusual mix of young Chinese educated at the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō in Japan, older Chinese who served in the Civil Wars, and Japanese officers part of the Military Mission to Fengtian, all united by common loyalties to individuals more than any special dedication to the state. Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in Fengtian, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population.\n\nNow, with the founding of the Shenyang National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, specifically a former fabric factory near central Shenyang. While a newer modern building rises nearby, the pitiful state of the academy at present leaves the government open to criticism."
fengtian.new.75.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fengtian.new.76.t:0 "Expel Japanese Officers"
fengtian.new.76.d:0 "Japan has maintained a military mission in Fengtian ever since the founding of the Fengtian Government in 1926, who were preceded by over a decade of informal Japanese operations in support of Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique. The Mission has served to aid many aspects of the military's development, primarily through the supply of arms and equipment, but also training and planning assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the shortage of officers in the aftermath of the civil wars provided Japan with the opportunity to attach Japanese officers to command positions in the field, and even lead our units independently. This has had a negative effect upon the morale of our men, making Japan's influence all too obvious, even as the Military Mission attempts, and often succeeds, in influencing our affairs of government. In order for our soldiers and the Chinese people to have any respect for our Government, the Japanese Military Mission must leave."
fengtian.new.76.a:0 "Expel them all!"
fengtian.new.76.b:0 "Let us be diplomatic."

fengtian.new.77.t:0 "Japan Declares War"
fengtian.new.77.d:0 "In response to our expulsion of their officers, the Japanese Government has cut all ties and declared war! Many will look at this as a disaster, but perhaps it is an opportunity in disguise. The truth will be found on the battlefield."

fengtian.new.78.t:0 "Japan Delivers an Ultimatum"
fengtian.new.78.d:0 "Despite our valiant attempts to remove the Japanese Military Mission, their influence in our government has proven to be too great, forcing us to reinstate the mission. The only other option now would be a rejection of the ultimatum and a declaration of war, lead by patriotic elements of the Zhang Clique."
fengtian.new.78.d_ultimatum:0 "Negotiations have failed and Japan has delivered a simple ultimatum. We must reinstate the mission or they will immediately declare war."
fengtian.new.78.a:0 "We have no choice but to submit."

fengtian.new.79.t:0 "Wu Wang Zai Ju"
fengtian.new.79.d:0 "The years since the formation of our Government have laid for us a solid foundation for national regeneration. We fear no problems, nor are we concerned over impending dangers. We merely lament the fate of the South, the freedom of which was originally brought about by the hard efforts and sacrifices of reformist patriots, and which has since been erased by the old and outmoded forms of government. Today, her people are powerless, and her rulers without integrity, thus allowing the slow degradation of the national condition, and the return to a state of total subservience to Western nations. These old ways are sapping China's national strength, shaking her national foundations, and subjugating her people.\n\nIt is thus that we find ourselves in the North, as the final bastion of all that our predecessors struggled to build, and the bearers of the future of a new China. The regressive Qing government likes to say that, by fortifying the Northeast, we are 'digging a hole to die in'. To this I say 'Forget not what happened in Ju'. It was to Ju that the State of Qi retreated, and from there that it reconquered all that it had lost. When the time is right, the Northeast will be our Ju, and the whole of China will be our Qi. The War of Southern Reclamation is inevitable, long live the Grand Marshal, long live the Republic!"

fengtian.new.80.t:0 "Retaking Chahar"
fengtian.new.80.d:0 "The time has come to return Chahar to its rightful owners, and throw back the Mad Baron's hordes. However, we must keep in mind that Sternberg is by no means a rational leader, and will not accept reasonable terms of negotiation or surrender unless he remains pressured from two sides. We cannot spare the resources to drive him to complete surrender and occupy his expansive territory, as this would distract from the ultimate objective of Southern Reclamation, and cause our people to doubt the sincerity of our devotion to the cause. As such, we must prosecute the war with as much haste as possible."
fengtian.new.80.a:0 "Forward!"

fengtian.new.81.t:0 "Victory in Chahar"
fengtian.new.81.d:0 "After seizing Chahar and holding it against the Baron's counterattacks, we have successfully concluded a peace, and achieved our goals. This is one small step in the struggle to reclaim all of China."

fengtian.new.81.b:0 "There will be no peace."

fengtian.new.82.t:0 "Doihara's Proposal"
fengtian.new.82.d:0 "Colonel Doihara, the head of the Kwantung Garrison's intelligence section, has come forward with a proposal he intends to implement with or without our assistance, though the former would be very much preferred.\n\nThe German intervention effectively closed the vast majority of the Chinese market to Japanese products, including particularly profitable goods like the 'Golden Bat' cigarette. Doihara intends access the old market through the re-branding of these cigarettes as 'Golden Dragons', then sale via the Legation Cities to avoid Qing embargoes, and most crucially the insertion of trace amounts of opium to ensure quick addiction. All we would need to do is support poppy production in key areas of Liaobei and Xing'an, and in time the profits could begin to flow.\n\nDoihara is a thoroughly unsavoury character, and our involvement in such a project could undermine our political legitimacy, but the government desperately needs funds, and this might provide an edge against the Qing."
fengtian.new.82.a:0 "Support the proposal."
fengtian.new.82.b:0 "We will have nothing to do with this."

fengtian.new.83.t:0 "Golden Dragon Cigarettes"

fengtian.new.84.d:0 "Communications from Doihara have been infrequent, scattered, and often evasive, until more recently when a he suggested a meeting in the old Astor House Hotel in Shanghai. Conveying his apologies for delays in his programme over a very expensive meal in the elaborate dining room, Doihara seemed genuinely frustrated, but after returning, our agent has been careful to emphasise that progress is still on track and the money will be flowing soon.\n\nOther intelligence operatives in the Legation Cities, and other parts of China, tell a rather different story, and suggest that the operation is already profitable, with the vast majority of the money being used to fund Doihara's other subversive activities. The evidence seems to suggest that our representative in Shanghai has been bribed, but surely Doihara will eventually cough up what he's promised..."

Insisting that he has run into trouble with the Green Gang, Doihara once again apologies for the delays, but insists that we will receive our funds within the next several months.\n\nMost of our operatives assigned to monitor Doihara's activities have mysteriously disappeared, so his actual status is difficult to ascertain."

fengtian.new.85.b:0 "We've had enough."

fengtian.new.86.t:0 "Doihara has Succeeded"

fengtian.new.86.a:0 "Excellent."

fengtian.new.87.t:0 "Discovery and Failure"
fengtian.new.87.d:0 "After a rapid series of arrests both within Qing jurisdiction and the Legation Cities, Doihara's plans appear to have failed, and the Colonel has cut all contact with us and presumably his former associates. Unfortunately, the Qing seem to have discovered our involvement and publicised the evidence. The political impact has already been devastating."
fengtian.new.87.a:0 "Damn!"

fengtian.new.89.t:0 "Doihara's Fate"
fengtian.new.89.d:0 "One of our agents monitoring Doihara's progress has forwarded some unfortunate news. It seems that, in his efforts to secure profitable transfer rates in Shanghai, Doihara made enemies of the Green Gang Triad. His body was reportedly found outside a back-alley brothel alongside those of several bodyguards, identifiable only thanks to its uniform and testimonies from nearby civilians.\n\nKempeitai agents have already begun an investigation in partnership with the Shanghai Municipal Police, but for all intents and purposes Doihara's initiative can be considered dead in the water."
fengtian.new.89.a:0 "So be it."

fengtian.new.90.t:0 "Opium Addiction Spreads in Qing"
fengtian.new.90.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of local officials and even the Qing Government, opium addiction has slowly spread among the general population to levels rivalling those of the Tongzhi and Guangxu Eras, weakening the 'central government' and its armies. This is to our advantage, but if our efforts to bring this state of affairs about become public knowledge the public relations impact will be difficult to contain. The Opium trade has long been viewed as not only as an evil, but one brought about primarily as a tool of Western imperialism."

The forces of justice will rise, and men of goodwill ultimately co-operate in the interests of rectitude. There is little question that the regressive and illegitimate Qing government stands in the way of progress, oppressing and subjugating the Chinese people, and I have received every assurance that our allies will stand with us to end this injustice. On our part, we should hold fast to our stand and fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success.\n\nIt is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal. And, when this year is done, the Five Colour Flag will fly high again in Beijing, and the Qing government will be nothing but ash in the winds of history. Ten thousand years to the Republic!

Recent discoveries by police, however, suggest this is operating on a level so far unheard of. It seems as if a group of Recovery League members, who were made mayors of townships in Jilin for their experience with governing in the South, had in fact never been mayors at all; killing and replacing their namesakes, and through a complicated plot of deceit, fooling the authorities while eliminating any who might contradict them.\n\nThe web of lies, corruption, and murder necessary to sustain this falsehood stretches across the whole of the Northeast, and the damage dealt to the government's legitimacy is not inconsiderable."

When the facilities were first constructed most of the ore required little digging, as the deposits lie close to the surface, but as of the current date more extensive excavation is required to continue operations. The company has begun this expansion work without acquiring a lease for the extra land from the local authorities, destroying several farm properties in the process, and despite promises neither compensation nor the lease have been forthcoming.\n\nProtests quickly broke out among local farmers over the issue, and quickly escalated into a riot that severely damaged expensive mining equipment, which our police refused to prevent, citing the technically illegal nature of the operations. On its own initiative, a nearby Japanese garrison from Anshan stepped in, and used lethal force to disperse the riot. This slaughter of our citizens has not gone unnoticed, and existing anti-Japanese sentiment has only been inflamed. The people will hold us accountable in our response, but the deposits and the company working them are essential to Japan's strategic goals, and our relationship with the Japanese permits little room to manoeuvre."

The Kwantung Garrison performed a series of motorised and armoured manoeuvres in full view of the capital, their message clear. Any escalation of this situation would undoubtedly result in further rebukes to which we can make no meaningful response."

The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."

The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests.\n\nThe broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of Qing's relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."

The article described in substantial detail the extensive degree to which Mantetsu and other Japanese companies have established control over most sectors of our economy, and set a forecast predicting near complete control within five years time.

fengtian.new.151.t:0 "The Bastion in the North"
fengtian.new.151.d:0 "As the year 1936 dawns, Fengtian stands in the Northeast as the final bastion of China's Republican dream. As with many things in China however, the abstractions of this dream hide complex and often inconvenient truths. The Fengtian Government of the Republic of China, contesting Qing's claims to legitimacy, maintains democracy only as a thin veneer, covering what has always been, and perhaps always will be, an authoritarian state.\n\nThe Assembly in Shenyang is widely regarded to be corrupt, power divided between autocratic generals, unscrupulous railway barons, and Pan-Asianist ideologues with questionable motivations. Amid it all stands Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, his ambitions great, but limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power; for now forced to walk a political tightrope between the two, and above the machinations of his own divided government. The status quo cannot last forever, and if the right moment to strike south is not chosen soon, it may never come at all.\n\nThe staggering cost of the wars with the south and the severance of economic ties left Fengtian reeling, and while past years have been spent rebuilding, there is much left to do. Likewise the army has suffered from neglect, and must be reorganised. The Japanese, their influence growing by the day, present both a dire threat and an opportunity. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of all China.\n\nBriefings are available on Fengtian's special mechanics, its relationship with the Japanese, and internal politics."

fengtian.new.152.d:0 "The Fengtian Government is unstable, pressured from without and within, ultimately a fusion of elements that would be contradictory were it not for their shared goals. The parties, more accurately termed factions, exercise their grip through dominance of the country's institutions instead of mass appeal. As such, the 'popularity' of parties should be taken to represent their degree of control over the country's government and other structures of power, control being determined not by the popular policies of ministers, but by choices, focuses, and events that increase or diminish their power.\n\nConsequently, your aim should be to balance the various factions, each of which has the potential to abuse their power if given too much of it, though each will do so differently. As they grow in strength, the factions will nominate ministers, each of whom will pursue his own agenda, potentially in line with his faction, or his country, but which could also have negative consequences in the short or long term.\n\nAnother crucial point is the role of the Concordia Association, also explained in the politics briefing, the strength of which can be taken as a loose indicator of Japanese influence over the country. As their influence grows, it will lead to increasing bonuses to production, but at the cost of political power and autonomy. The rise of this influence is inevitable over time, and should be viewed with caution."

While the Grand Marshal and others utilise a wide variety of means to slow and inconvenience the Japanese, their presence is necessary and the growth of their influence inevitable. The primary institution responsible for this growth is the South Manchuria Railway Company, more commonly termed 'Mantetsu', the profits from which in recent years have accounted for nearly a quarter of Japan's entire national budget.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese need Fengtian and what it represents. Its cooperation and the prospect of a victory in the South offer to save Japan a great deal of time and money. The result is a tenuous balance, the Japanese ever looking for more profit and power, but well aware that pushing too hard will place Zhang Zuolin in a politically untenable position, and thus bring their careful efforts to naught.\n\nSo far Zhang has pursued a patchwork policy; promotion of Pan-Asian brotherhood with Japan, only to intermittently replace this with repudiations of Japanese initiatives that push too far, and consistent private efforts to lessen Japanese influence. How to proceed will be your choice, but caution is advised."

Easily bribed and tempted, they often serve to promote the interests of whoever is willing to pay, and consequently the 'league' is highly splintered despite controlling a large portion of the Assembly, lacking the political will to act decisively.\n\n2. The Zhang Clique\n\nA collection of loyalists and generals, the Zhang Clique holds no specific ideology beyond promoting the furtherance of the Grand Marshal's political powers. While making pretences to democracy, Zhang's supporters are not committed to republican ideals, and promote them only for their utility.\n\n3. The Communications Clique\n\nThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique are a collection of railroad and telegraph barons, primarily self-interested, but locked in confrontation with Mantetsu and the Concordia Association over the country's infrastructure.\n\n4. The Concordia Association\n\nA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly. Their actual ideological positions vary, some using the Japanese to counter Zhang's power for their own gain, with others subscribing to Pan-Asian principles."

However, the League is a far cry from the political party it is often believed to be, lacking functional leadership and clear direction at its higher levels; its lower levels falling prey to various special interests and personal squabbles. The result is a government unable to govern, and while the Grand Marshal is able to use his extensive powers to ensure continued order, this and the League's unscrupulous actions tear at the government's already thin veil of legitimacy.\n\nThe balance must be restored if the country is to prosper."

Even the Recovery League, usually considered politically impotent, has staged protests, rallied by a cause célèbre.\n\nThe situation is worsened by the Zhang Clique's now frequent abuses of power and attempts to retaliate through force.

fengtian.new.167.d:0 "Communicating by mounted messenger, General Ma Zhanshan of the Fengtian Government has offered to defect, citing his once close relationship with Zhang Zuolin, but his growing dissatisfaction with the Grand Marshal's political overreach. Zhang is known to be an effective, if eccentric general, spending much of his time practicing his superb marksmanship; likely a product of the early life he spent roaming the Northeastern plain.\n\nAll the former bandit asks for in return is the latest equipment to outfit his men and three million dollars worth of gold."

Unfortunately, Qing forces were quick to cut-off and surround Ma's troops, resulting in a vicious battle that left the ambitious general dead.

The locomotive wonder bears cars outfitted with heat, air conditioning, and luxurious lounges for even third class customers, as well as its very own signature cocktail served at the bar.\n\nWhile Mantetsu's unimitigated success has given some reason to cheer, and may strike envy in Qing, the Communications Clique can only view Mantetsu's advancements with growing concern."

fengtian.new.174.d:0 "For reasons probably associated with his recent ministerial appointment, Lu Ronghuan has gifted the Grand Marshal a splendid Manchurian pony named 'Pong', a rare breed supposedly capable of performing tricks, and worth nearly a million Yen. Exchanges of gifts, which might be interpreted as bribes in other countries, are a common sight in the Northeast and across China, but Lu's deep pockets are known for producing all manner of expensive oddities."

However, the major lines running from Dairen to Harbin have suddenly experienced a series of strikes, shutting down service in protest of the proposed legislation.\n\nFaced with this overwhelming rejection, the legislation has been shelved for the timebeing, and it seems likely that Li Shaogeng and his widespread contacts are responsible."
fengtian.new.175.d_Liang:0 "As of early this morning the major railway lines running between Dairen, Shenyang, and Harbin have experienced near total shutdowns as strikes seemingly spontaneously erupted along them, effectively grinding the country's resource economy to a halt.\n\nMantetsu and its advocates in the Concordia Association seem to have taken the opportunity to ship in workers from the Kwantung Leased Territory to ensure that basic services continue to run, but the strike has continued nontheless; demonstrating Liang Shiyi's willingness to damage even his own cause in response to refusal by the Grand Marshal."

Evidence has come to the Grand Marshal's attention suggesting that vast sums of development money were funnelled into private projects and accounts across the country.

Evidence has come to the Grand Marshal's attention suggesting that vast sums of development money were funnelled into desperate measures to compete with Mantetsu across the country, a vast majority in the form of bribes. On top of this, Li has abused his position to ensure favourable rights for construction efforts lead by his allies in government.

Or has he?\n\nAn image depicting Tang has circulated widely, appearing in newspapers across the Northeast, though its origin is unclear. Some claim that the image is doctored, while others believe the tiger is only stuffed, but the aspect garnering the most attention is the context. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin is often referred to as 'The Mukden Tiger', and so the fact that Tang is shown riding one paints a very questionable picture.\n\nOn his part, Tang Yulin claims that the image is the creation of a Qing saboteur, but his extravegant parties in Chaoyang suggests that the image, if not the tiger, may well be genuine."

fengtian.new.181.t:0 "The CER Tax Dispute"
fengtian.new.181.d:0 "The levying of seemingly arbitrary taxes to fill gaps in the budget, genuine or not, has been a long standing practice of national, regional, and local governments across China, including our own. This time Interior Minister Yuan is pressuring the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and Economic Minister, Li Shaogeng, to levy additional taxes on the railway for the purposes of further strengthening the army; threatening an investigation of Communications Clique assets, as well as various fees the Board already charges its customers, the revenue from which almost certainly sticks to a number of fingers.\n\nThere is every likelyhood that, as Yuan is a member of the CER board himself, this is a power-play on his part to weaken his rivals, but such a tax would undoubtedly help fill the national treasury, if at the cost of undercutting competition to Mantetsu. It seems likely that the Grand Marshal will be forced to settle this dispute, lest it spiral out of control."
fengtian.new.181.a:0 "Levy the tax."
fengtian.new.181.b:0 "No tax is necessary."

fengtian.new.182.t:0 "Yuan Investigates Regardless"
fengtian.new.182.d:0 "Seething over the decision to prevent his rail-tax proposal, Minister Yuan Jinkai has gone ahead with his threat to intensively investigate the other members of the CER Board, as well as the Communications Clique at large. Already police forces have begun to converge, and unless the Grand Marshal intercedes soon, there is an increasing risk that the investigation could uncover larger secrets best kept from the public eye.\n\nOf course, if his investigation is stopped, Yuan will almost certainly resign his position as Minister of the Interior."
fengtian.new.182.a:0 "This will not be tolerated."
fengtian.new.182.b:0 "Let the investigation go ahead."

fengtian.new.183.t:0 "Yuan's Investigation Yields Results"
fengtian.new.183.d_large:0 "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government, and the subject of those fears has now come to pass. Though the Communications Clique has been hit hardest by this scandal, the government as a whole has suffered a serious blow to its legitimacy, despite Yuan's best efforts to keep the full results under wraps. Though there have been calls for Yuan to resign, damage control takes priority, and the Interior Minister has earned a great deal of respect from the general population, ironic though it may be."
fengtian.new.183.d_small:0 "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government, but fortunately its results squarely target members of the Communications Clique, leaving the government largely unscathed. Yuan will almost certainly walk away with a greater degree of control over the CER, and greater respect among the general population, despite his own 'alleged' shady dealings."
fengtian.new.183.a:0 "At least it's finished."

fengtian.new.184.t:0 "Yuan's Investigation Yields Nothing"
fengtian.new.184.d:0 "Despite the widespread belief that Yuan's investigation would inevitably uncover some trace of Communications Clique corruption, the official report released today indicates that nothing was found. Yuan is deeply displeased, but there is little he can do short of escalating the conflict in a way guaranteed to do considerable damage to his own reputation."

fngpolitic.1.d_Wu:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Wu Jinglian, former speaker of the Beiyang Assembly, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Wu has served in the position before, and is known for his fierce opposition to the regressive Qing monarchy, though he has also been an outspoken critic of Japanese involvement in China. As a result, he could be a vital asset in the propaganda war against Qing, or a substantial inconvenience in our complicated relationship with Japan.\n\nWu's extant ties to the Foreign Ministry and its importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision rests with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.1.d_Chang:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Chang Chun, a prominent politician with close ties to Huang Fu and the late Dr Sun Yat-sen, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Having studied at the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko before the Revolution, Chang can be said to have a working understanding with the Japanese while still remaining distant from the Concordia Society, making him especially well suited to manage the complicated relationship between our two governments.\n\nThe Recovery League's ties to the Foreign Ministry means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the Grand Marshal can veto the decision at any time."
fngpolitic.1.d_Huang:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Huang Fu, former Speaker of the Assembly, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. His reputation as a man of character makes him well suited to to the task, but his resolute republican values have made his relationship with the Grand Marshal one of cooperation against mutual enemies, and he will undoubtedly react poorly to further consolidation of the Grand Marshal's already sweeping powers.\n\nHuang's prominence and the Foreign Ministry's importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision will be made by the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.1.d_Huang_hog:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Huang Fu, our current Speaker of the Assembly and Head of Government, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is not unheard of for especially powerful politicians and warlords to consolidate power through occupying multiple posts, and his reputation as a man of character makes him well suited to deflect suspicion and accusations of misappropriated power. All the same, his resolute republican values have made his relationship with the Grand Marshal one of cooperation against mutual enemies, and he will undoubtedly react poorly to further consolidation of the Grand Marshal's already sweeping powers.\n\nHuang's prominence and the Foreign Ministry's importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision will be made by the Grand Marshal."

Pan is known to be an experienced in the role, having served both under the Beiyang Government and our own, but during that time he built up an unfortunate reputation for shady dealings and corruption. He has yet to be convicted of any crime, and it's even possible that these widely held suspicions are unfounded, but his past seems likely to haunt him if he reoccupies his old post.\n\nDespite the risk, the Recovery League's advantage in government means that only the Grand Marshal can prevent his appointment."
fngpolitic.2.d_Chang:0 "With the Foreign Ministry firmly under their control, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Chang Chun as a replacement for its current occupant. Chang has relatively little experience with fiscal and financial matters, leading most to suspect that his nomination is more a product of intra-party politics than one based on merit. Despite this, Chang remains a respected politician, and the Recovery League's strong position in government means that only the Grand Marshal himself can stand in the way of his appointment."
fngpolitic.2.d_Chang_for:0 "With the Foreign Ministry firmly under their control, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Chang Chun as a replacement for its current occupant. Unfortunately Chang has relative little experience suiting him to the task, and his nomination alongside his extant role as Minister of Foreign Affairs seems to be evidence of his growing power within the party more than any particular fiscal or financial merit.

Of course, Yen does not come without political baggage, and he is known to have little tolerance for the Grand Marshal's more autocratic tendencies and a strong distrust of Japanese motives, both of which could prove inconvenient in the long run.\n\nOf course, the Grand Marshal could always refuse to appoint him."

Wu Jinglian is a well respected politician, though has little experience marking him as suitable for the role, and it seems as if this will become increasingly apparent over time. All the same, the Recovery League desires full control of the nation's core ministries, and only the Grand Marshal can prevent them getting what they want."
fngpolitic.4.d_Wu_hog:0 "With their appointees now filling most positions of power, the Recovery League looks to replace the current Head of Intelligence with one of their own. Wu Jinglian is a curious choice, in large part because of his simultaneous role as Foreign Minister, but also because has has virtually no experience readying him for the task. The Recovery League's choice is likely a product of intra-party politics, but might allow Wu to coordinate the Foreign Ministry and Intelligence Services in a way previously made difficult by political differences between the ministries.\n\nThe decision of whether or not to appoint Wu lies with the Grand Marshal."

fngpolitic.5.d_Li:0 "Thanks to their growing strength in government, the Communications Clique has nominated Li Shaogeng to fill the position of Economic Minister. Granted the role of Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929, Li has never been particularly outspoken or charismatic, but maintains an intricate network of back-channels and secret agreements with low level officials and bureaucrats across the Northeast. His most important relationships, however, are with the railway unions, which work with the Communications Clique to oppose Mantetsu and Japanese influence in return for rights, benefits, and control over the workplace.\n\nLi is known to be silently competent, but the Grand Marshal can always choose to prevent the appointment."

However, this same background has left him illiterate, particularly hostile to the Japanese, and without any formal military training whatsoever.\n\nAlready, members of the other factions have voiced their complaints about the placement of a 'bandit lord' on the cabinet, even including some other members of the Zhang Clique, and it seems clear that the appointment was secured by Ma's patron Wu Junsheng.\n\nThe decision is left with the Grand Marshal."

Governor of Jehol, and promised rule of Chahar before his forces were driven out of it by Ungern's cavalry at the end of the Civil Wars, Tang is known to be something of an administrative blunderer, and his support for the Qing Restoration of 1917 has left him unpopular in some circles. As a result, his appointment seems likely to be a product of Clique internal politics, or merely well placed bribes funded by his considerable wealth.\n\nShort of any ill-advised attempts to open conflict over Chahar, or any administrative embarrassments, Tang stands to be a low-key minister unlikely to stir political competition. Of course, the Grand Marshal can always refuse the appointment."

Yang Yuting, however, is well known as a close associate of the Concordia Association, and the lack of clarity regarding Zang and Yang's relationship has made the former a number of enemies.\n\nThough Zang certainly could have secured enough support to earn the nomination on his own, there is some suspicion that he is being set up to take a fall.
