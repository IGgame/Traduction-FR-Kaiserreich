 LIT_totalist_party_long:0 "Studentų socialistų aušrininkų draugija 'Aušrinė'     §gThe Society of Socialist Students 'Aušrininkai' is a semi-formal student movement which first organised around the magazine Aušrinė ('Morning Star') in 1910. Not long after inception, it took a straight dive towards socialism, influence by Benoît Malon and Peter Kropotkin, and, ultimately, revolutionary syndicalism. It was forced out of schools and universities and ultimately banned by executive order in 1923, but continued spreading its ideas through the underground. Using dummy organisations to cover up their activities and publishing their magazine through ever changing names and titles, and sometimes taking up in left-wing terrorism, they remain a headache for any Lithuanian government. Aušrinė stands out among worldwide Syndicalist organisations by being a 'writers' party' - the absolute majority of their members are intellectuals, poets and writers, as such it is a lively community and their ideology is untainted, but they command little popular support.§!"

The radical wing of the LSDP calls for no compromise with Lithuania's status as a monarchy, nor its domination by Germans, and instead looks towards France and other Syndicalist states as its potential saviours. Despite these radical stances, they maintain a constant presence in the party and hold significant influence over its leadership as well as ordinary membership.§!"

 LIT_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija                          §gThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian left wing and proudly calls itself the oldest political party in Lithuania. Its history stretches to 1896, although it only became a Lithuanian party foremost in 1902. Although the LSDP commanded great influence over the Lithuanian independence movement, it was forced out of the Council of Lithuania due to its republican stances, an act which many hold grudges for ever since. In the independent Kingdom of Lithuania, they have moderated their anti-monarchist position, but its condition as an anti-German, anti-capitalist party has allowed it to become a big tent movement for the Lithuanian left wing. The core of the party is influenced by the German SPD and Austromarxism, and while it remains a democratic party at heart, it does not disdain socialist or outright Syndicalist influence. This Petri dish of left-wing ideas collected to one organisation makes it rather difficult to achieve a consensus, however.§!"

 LIT_social_liberal_party:0 "KPL/LLK"
 LIT_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Lietuvos lenkų komitetas/Komitet Polaków na Litwie §gThe Committee of Lithuanian Poles is the largest of many ethnic minority parties in the Kingdom of Lithuania, originally founded in 1920 to contest the first democratic elections in the country. It is a party that unites Lithuanian Polish interests and campaigns for issues that matter to them first and foremost, such as cultural and political autonomy, funding of Polish language education in Białystok and Vilnius regions, and deeper economic, cultural and political ties with Poland. Aside from these core issues, the party is largely non-ideological, the political positions of their members varying from aristocratic conservatism to near-Syndicalism.§!"

 LIT_market_liberal_party:0 "Santara"
 LIT_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Demokratinė tautos laisvės santara                     §gThe Democratic National Freedom League, more commonly known as just Santara, is a minor liberal political party in Lithuania which was first founded by many famous Lithuanian politicians in exile in 1917. Based in Petrograd, this party campaigned for Lithuania's future as a democratic republic and tied its future with the Entente, believing that Russian victory in the Eastern Front and Lithuanian autonomy within a greater Russian federation would be the best outcome for Lithuania as a whole. This never came to be, however, and Santara was thus cast out of any influence in building the foundations of the Kingdom. Santara is commonly known as the 'party of veterans'. Its leaders all became involved in politics before the Weltkrieg and were invited to hold ministries in various past governments, but the party does not command nearly as much influence among the population. It is an outlet for liberal ideas in Lithuania - Santara champions secularism, religious tolerance, liberalism, and sees itself as a mediator between the left and the right.§!"

 LIT_social_conservative_party:0 "LKPD"
 LIT_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Lietuvos krikščionių demokratų partija                    §gThe Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party of the Lithuanian right wing, originally founded in 1917, although its predecessor movements are claimed to have started operating as early as 1890. A leading proponent of conservatism and monarchism in the Lithuanian political arena, it laid down the foundations for the Kingdom of Lithuania and has remained an extremely influential party since. Because of its vast size, the party has several distinct wings - some of its members are more willing to endorse liberal ideas and reconcile with the left, others are not; some see Lithuania's future as a loyal disciple of Germany, some are wary of being constantly reigned over by godless Lutherans, others are more nationalistic. Some are influenced by Christian corporatism or even Christian socialism, others are staunch conservatives or free market proponents. Regardless of the wing, however, ideas such as Christian ethics, monarchism, and democracy unite them all.§!"

The Nationalist Union unites around the larger than life persona of Antanas Smetona, once the head of the Council of Lithuania and the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, turned the leader of the Lithuanian nationalist cause. The failure of the Memel Uprising of 1928 taught Smetona that militant resistance against the Germans is futile, freedom from their grasp can only be achieved through the ballot, thus the Nationalist Union disdains any talks of armed rebellion and instead seek to implement their ideas (mostly) democratically. It believes in the need of a strong executive, in corporatist and state controlled economics, support for Lithuanian nationalism, and the ever present slogan of 'Lithuania for Lithuanians!'. Despite its professed allegiance to the King and Democracy, it comes into direct conflict with the Lithuanian left wing, which see them as a direct road towards authoritarianism.§!"

Il unit les forces radicales, militantes et réactionnaires du spectre politique lituanien, ceux qui ne peuvent trouver place dans aucun parti politique légal. Les connaissances sur le fonctionnement du mouvement sont très rares, mais on pense qu'ils n'ont pas de leader universellement reconnu et qu'ils sont partagés entre plusieurs visions politiques influentes - malgré cela, cependant, un sentiment unificateur de haine envers l'Allemagne, le gouvernement de Vilnius et les non-Lituaniens leur permet de ne pas dissoudre. Ils ont diffusé leur idéologie à travers des magazines tels que Vairas, Naujoji Romuva et  Tautos Kelias (Le Chemin de la Nation), ainsi que des manifestations organisées, des raids et des activités terroristes occasionnelles.

 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_VYTAUTAS_II_DESC:0 "'Scandal' roared Lithuanian newspapers in 1928, upon the reveal that the heir apparent of Lithuania was courting a woman beneath his station - to his younger brother, Karl Gero von Urach, this was the end of the world he knew, and the beginning of a horror show. A young man who had once dreamt of becoming an architect was now forced to leave his home in Wurttemberg to rule over a nation. And not just any nation - a nation poorer than the dinkiest German borough, divided between numerous ethnicities and religions and suffering numerous internal political, social and economic problems. Perhaps rightfully so, Vytautas II has been seen as a weak and lethargic puppet of the Seimas, a tool of sycophants, and a laughing stock among European monarchs, ever since his coronation.\n\nIn truth, he is a man consumed by melancholy and crushed dreams. Though he has gained some experience in political operations during a decade of rule, there is nothing he yearns for more than a return to normalcy. A return to his passion for architecture, a return to his home in Germany. Only a strong feeling of duty to his father's will keeps him in the Verkiai Palace."

 LIT_MINDAUGAS_III_DESC:0 "Quatrième et plus jeune fils de la famille von Urach, Eberhard n'aurait jamais pu espérer devenir un jour roi de Lituanie. Ayant rejoint l'armée lorsqu'il était encore jeune homme, il a été choisi pour diriger le pays à la place de son frère Albert, plus intéressé par l'art, ses partisans espérant qu'il se révélera plus sensible à leur gouvernement axé sur l'armée."

 POLITICS_STANISLAW_NARUTOWICZ_DESC:0 "Stanisław Narutowicz was the only member of the Council of Lithuania who signed its acts of independence in Polish, rather than Lithuanian, an action which has been interpreted numerous ways - but the one preferred by the elderly noble is that it is a sign that the Lithuanian cause is not just an ethnic Lithuanian or a peasant cause. The nobility and the Lithuanian Poles, such as himself, were just as critical to see an independent Lithuanian state arise. Narutowicz's political career has lasted for decades, starting with the Revolution of 1905, when he started the so-called 'Republic of Alsėdžiai' in the surroundings of his manor, and travelled across the Governorate to call people to the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Narutowicz was a member of the left faction of the Council of Lithuania and campaigned for a republic first and foremost, but ultimately conceded to the monarchist cause.\n\nThe leader of the Committee of Lithuanian Poles is perhaps the only Pole whom even Lithuanian nationalists, such as Antanas Smetona, respect - his efforts for an independent Lithuanian state are well known and so is his unyielding support for democracy, the rights of all minorities in Lithuania, and social justice."

 POLITICS_STASYS_SALKAUSKIS_DESC:0 "Né dans une famille de petite noblesse d'origine polonaise et lituanienne, Stasys Šalkauskis a eu une éducation modeste et faisait partie d'une nouvelle génération d'intellectuels de langue lituanienne, des derniers jours de l'empire russe. Son domaine de prédilection était le droit à l'Université de Moscou, une décision qui allait guider son chemin dans la vie à partir de là - l'expérience de l'atmosphère nihiliste et athée du renseignement russe l'a forcé à s'accrocher encore plus profondément à sa foi catholique, réalisant que son universalisme et sa compassion, soutenus par une philosophie réfléchie, sont la meilleure réponse aux questions fondamentales de la vie. Ces croyances ont été renforcées par une correspondance avec Adomas Jakštas et des études à l'Université catholique de Fribourg, en Suisse.\n\nŠalkauskis n'est pas un politicien de métier et trouve la philosophie beaucoup plus confortable, mais sa vision complexe d'une nouvelle société chrétienne compatissante a influencé de nombreux membres du Parti démocrate-chrétien. Un mouvement vers un « système de gouvernement optimal », un besoin d'un gouvernement guidé par la solidarité et l'anticapitalisme, et une interprétation holistique de la Lituanie comme synthèse de la culture orientale et occidentale sont les principaux points de son idéologie."

 POLITICS_LIT_PRIVY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Chaired by §YBaron Went von der Ropp§!\n\nIt is spoken by the inhabitants of the Pakruojis parish that the only thing which stood between Went von der Ropp and a fulfilled life was inheriting the Pakruojis Manor, the most famous and prestigious palace owned by the Lithuanian-German von der Ropp family - and, in fact, the young noble had dedicated his life and effort to managing the manor while its owner, Leon von der Ropp, was infirm and incapacitated. However, the elderly baron saw something threatening in the man, and with an excuse of not liking the young noble's spouse, he left Went out of the succession, leaving him with nothing but a small local holding and a noble title. It may only be a rumour, but it would explain the personality of Baron von der Ropp, a cunning, embittered, possibly even sociopathic man.\n\nHaving been admitted to the Privy Council of the King of Lithuania despite his youth, von der Ropp swiftly became a close associate of the King thanks to being the only member of the Council under forty years of age. He wielded his influence as the King's personal advisor to rise through the political arena, ultimately becoming the head of the Lithuanian-German Cultural Association (Kulturverband der Deutschen Litauen), a front for the influence of the German Empire in Lithuania. Holding no warm feelings towards Lithuanians - those impoverished, dirty, uncultured peasants, who threaten to nationalise his manor and end his way of life - von der Ropp looks to the West, dreaming of finishing the historical mission of the Teutonic Knights by attaching Lithuania to the German sphere, through force and blood if need be."

 LIT_GENERAL_RASTIKIS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 13th, 1896\nKuršėnai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhen the Weltkrieg began, the eighteen year old Stasys Raštikis was one of the hundreds of thousands who volunteered for the Imperial Russian Army while overtaken by the war fever. Unlike many of his peers, however, the following four years of war did not erode this enthusiasm - in fact, it only strengthened it. The Russian officers in the Eastern Front and in the Tiflis Army Academy were quick to note the Lithuanian youth's enthusiasm. Upon the conclusion of hostilities in the East, Raštikis was in Georgia, where he and the rest of the Lithuanian cadets residing in the Academy received German approval to return to their homeland. He abandoned his former plans of becoming a priest in favour of pursuing a life in the military.\n\nAt forty years old, Raštikis is rather young considering his rank, but he is a bright and energetic mind, open to new ideas of warfare and loyal to his country. It is said that the bald, stern-faced General is the most politically powerful of all Lithuanian army commanders - he has close ties to the Christian Democratic Party of Lithuania and is a personal friend of Leonas Bistras, while at the same time, he is married to Elena Smetonaitė, the niece of Antanas Smetona. Those claiming that he exerts any influence from the shadows are merely repeating conspiracies, however - dedicated to the military and the good of his country, Raštikis professes complete independence from any political affairs."

It is not even sure whether his parents are actually Lithuanian, or whether they had immigrated to Lithuania sometime during the 19th century. A Lutheran Protestant married to a Baltic German noble Josephine Hasdorf, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army, reaching the rank of Major General in 1916. He crossed the Soviet-German border in 1918, after the October Revolution, and was appointed the first Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian armed forces, holding this position for over a decade.\n\nThough elderly and reclusive, Silvestras Žukauskas holds insurmountable respect among his fellow Lithuanian officers, and still occasionally offers advice for his younger peers - even though, over the years, the armed forces under his command started to steadily degrade and Žukauskas struggled to garner the initiative for reform."

 LIT_GENERAL_CERNIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJanuary 6th, 1898\nKupiškis, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe call for volunteers to the Lithuanian Army reached Jonas Černius, the son of a bricklayer, while he was still enrolled in the Panevėžys Gymnasium, but that did not stop him from abandoning his past life in order to become one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian Army. He was handpicked as one of the few soldiers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces to further their military education in Berlin, where he became a military engineer - perhaps because he inherited his father's passion for construction and building. During these studies, he became acquainted with Stasys Raštikis, who had also been sent to Berlin as a part of the Lithuanian mission, and the two of them became close allies. Wherever Raštikis proposes reforms and changes to the Lithuanian army, Černius is sure to follow suit, the two generals united by nationalist pride and loyal service to their fatherland."

 LIT_GENERAL_SKIRPA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 18th, 1895\nNabajūnai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in the northernmost reaches of Lithuania, Škirpa never once questioned his Lithuanian identity, unlike several of his peers, and proudly declared himself to be a patriot since the earliest days. The February Revolution in Russia saw him, an officer stationed in Omsk, travel across the entirety of the disintegrating Empire, through hardship and danger, until he reached Vilnius in the first half of 1918. Seeing the Council of Lithuania paralysed and the Germans have free reign in his homeland disappointed him, however. Against the will of the Council and the Ober Ost administration, he organised a Lithuanian volunteer unit in Vilnius, engaging in street clashes with Polish paramilitaries and raising the flag of Lithuania atop the Gediminas Tower on January 1st, 1919, before it was taken down by German authorities the day after.\n\nDespite this futile resistance, he ended up acquitted and became one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army. It is suspected that Lt. General Škirpa had a hand in organising the Memel Uprising as well, but all that can be said against him is hearsay and rumours. It is a fact, however, that Škirpa is by far the most right wing and nationalist of the Lithuanian high command, holding no warm feelings towards the German occupation he once fought, nor the Poles he has had bad blood with since 1918."

 LIT_GENERAL_REKLAITIS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 6th, 1896\nDaugirdėliai, Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in the Alytus region and known among his fellow generals for his strong Dzūkijan accent, Mikas Rėklaitis did not initially wish to be a military officer. He was conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army upon finishing education in the Veiveriai Seminary and served until January of 1918, when he was taken prisoner by advancing German forces and remained in captivity for most of the year. He was freed in November of 1918 and began organising self-defence units in his home region. These units ended up integrated into the nascent Lithuanian army and Rėklaitis accepted his new career in life. Among other things, he is responsible for the drafting of the Infantry Unit Organisation Statute of the Lithuanian army in 1923, and has remained a firm supporter of the role of the foot soldier on the battlefield since."

 LIT_GENERAL_VITKAUSKAS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 4th, 1890\nUžbaliai, Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nVincas Vitkauskas was not drawn to a life of war at first. A bright mind and an artistic soul, he was a maths student and a poet before getting conscripted to the Imperial Russian Army - this origin reflects itself in Vitkauskas's texts and memoirs, which always use vivid, expressive language, unusual for an army officer. After two years of service in Ukraine, he returned to his homeland once again, where he signed up for Lithuania's armed forces - there, he gained the reputation of a lenient, socialite commander, who preferred to win the hearts and minds of his men instead of instilling discipline to them through force.\n\nVitkauskas's career in the Lithuanian army has been difficult. Unlike many of his fellow politically neutral officers, he does not shy away from the fact that he disapproves of the Christian Democrats and the Nationalist Union, and holds progressive political views. This has led to him being passed over for promotion several times in his past - only the intervention of Stasys Raštikis ensured that he would finally acquire the rank of Major General he was worthy of in 1935."

 LIT_GENERAL_ZELIGOWSKI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 17th, 1865\nAšmena/Oszmiana/Ashmiany, Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLike many of his fellow Lithuanian commanders, Lucjan Żeligowski started his career in the Imperial Russian Army - the difference is that, upon the fall of the Tsarist regime, he swore not to the nascent Kingdom of Lithuania, but rather to the Polish nation next door. Commanding the 4th Polish Rifle Division in Kuban, he ultimately became the supreme commander of all Polish volunteer units in the Russian Civil War, fighting alongside the Whites in southern and eastern Russia. Żeligowski finally crossed the Russian-German border in 1919, but what he saw shattered his dreams - the Polish nation he sought to fight for had been reduced to a shadow of its former self, beset by political instability, and holding but a smidgen of all of its rightful land. His friend Jozef Piłsudski was imprisoned by the Kaiser's minions and Poles kowtowed to Berlin's will.\n\nDefeated, Żeligowski put aside the dreams of unified Polish people for now, and focused on the task at hand - to speak for the Poles in Lithuania, and to strive for Lithuania where Poles are free to express their culture - and perhaps, one day, unite with their brothers in south."

 LIT_GENERAL_LADIGA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 25th, 1893\nIškonys, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nKazys Ladiga's military career started with his service as a reconnaissance scout in the Imperial Russian Army - for his bravery and several wounds he endured, he was awarded the Cross of St. George. He was one of the few Lithuanian officers who did not defect after the February Revolution - instead, he remained in service until February of 1918, when he and his entire unit were taken prisoner by advancing German forces in Dunaburg. Ladiga remained imprisoned for almost a year until he was found by Konstantinas Olšauskas, a delegate from the Council of Lithuania, and bailed out in order to join the developing Lithuanian armed forces.\n\nKazys Ladiga is a staunch abstinent and Christian, but suffers from nefarious voices claiming that he is a communist sympathiser - after all, he remained in the Russian Army even after the October Revolution, unlike his peers, who defected as soon as the military began to disintegrate."

 LIT_GENERAL_ADAMKAVICIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 30th, 1888\nPikeliai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nIt is said that Aide-de-Camp Edvardas Adamkavičius, serving in the 64th Kazan Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army in 1915, was responsible for reviewing the lists of newly recruited officers. Among this list, he saw one or two Lithuanian surnames - and immediately reached out to those men to speak to them only in Lithuanian from then on out. A stalwart Lithuanian nationalist and a respected general, Adamkavičius was one of the first volunteers in the Royal Lithuanian Armed Forces upon his return in November of 1918. Though of somewhat poor health, owing to miraculously surviving a bullet going through his head during the Weltkrieg, the moustached general commands great respect from his peers and junior officers."

 LIT_GENERAL_PLECHAVICIUS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 1st, 1890\nŽidikai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nPovilas Plechavičius hails from a family of wealthy farmers in Samogitia. Upon the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he was a cavalry officer in the Imperial Russian Army and fought in the Eastern and Caucasus Fronts, reportedly getting wounded twenty nine times, and yet returning for more every single time. The October Revolution found him while he was stationed in the Caucasus, but did not discourage him one bit - posing as a Cossack, he joined Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and fought alongside the Whites against the Bolshevik uprising in the Russian south. Though his service there was brief, it instilled Plechavičius with a deep and seething hatred for communism - alongside his brother Aleksas, he returned to Lithuania in the fall of 1918.\n\nPlechavičius found Lithuania in chaos and disorder, infested with bandits and Bolshevik sympathisers, where the German authorities held a tenuous grip. He organised a band of Samogitian men, which soon grew into an army, and enacted a policy of White terror in northern and western Lithuania. Though his methods were effective in restoring order in his home, even receiving tacit German authority approval, the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was horrified by the brutality. Threatened by the Social Democratic deputy Liuda Purėnienė with legal action, Plechavičius defended himself simply: 'Honourable justices, if me or a person like me weren't there at the time, none of us would be sitting here today'. He was acquitted, albeit controversially, and became a folk hero among the Lithuanian military."

The Seimas, according to the project, shall be divided into three Houses - a universally elected 'House of Ideological Communities', a 'Little Seimas' composed of Federal representatives, and a 'House of Corporations' directly elected from trade unions, business owners, and agricultural communities. Each of the three Houses of the Seimas will appoint five ministries, all of whom will be controlled by the State Control Commission and finally overseen by the King.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to form an 'optimal state', one where the voice of any citizen is heard, one whose inhabitants identify with 'Lithuania' as a concept rather than one of many numerous ethnic groups, much like they had in the Grand Duchy centuries past.\n\nThis state, according to Šalkauskis's vision, will serve as a bridge between East and West and lead all of humanity to a new age.\n\n§CFederalisation Progress§!: [?LIT_federalisation|0+]%"

### Events ###
 LIT.1.t:0 "Le Royaume de Lituanie"
 LIT.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania was officially founded on December 11th, 1917, and this declaration was reiterated on February 16th, 1918, by the Council of Lithuania, a body of Lithuanian politicians and public figures elected in the Vilnius Conference during the Weltkrieg. The formation of the Kingdom was far from easy, however - the declaration split Lithuanian nationalists and forced the republican-leaning Social Democrats (LSDP) out of the Council, while it only took until 1919 for the Germans to take the declaration of independence seriously. Ultimately, they confirmed Wilhelm von Urach as Mindaugas II, the first King of Lithuania since 1263.\n\nThe Constitution of 1920 established Lithuania as a bicameral constitutional monarchy, guaranteeing basic rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and universal suffrage. To this day, it remains one of the most liberal constitutions in the Reichspakt. Lacking serious competition, the Christian Democrats (LKDP) have formed the government since the country's inception, while the economy of the country remains dominated by German Junkers and company branches. The absolute majority of them are established in Vilnius, declared a city for 'German Development' - the lion's share of foreign investment is directed there and it has become a jewel of the Oststaaten, a place where you can hear five different languages on your way from the grocery shop. The rest of Lithuania is underdeveloped, however. This is most obvious in the so-called 'Outer Lithuania', the Slavic-speaking southern districts, which, more often than not, look like they are stuck in the 19th century.\n\nVytautas II, also known as Karl Gero von Urach, is the King of Lithuania since 1928. The incumbent Prime Minister is Leonas Bistras, representing the Christian Democrats."
 LIT.1.a:0 "Encore..."
 LIT.1.b:0 "Je le sais déjà"

 LIT.2.t:0 "Souvenir du Soulèvement de Memel"
 LIT.2.d:0 "Nationalism in Lithuania, briefly quenched by the declaration of independence at the end of the Weltkrieg, saw a resurgence during the 1920s. The laws of free expression allowed a revival of Lithuanian culture - numerous nationalist inclined arts and culture movements began to appear, the Prussian Lithuanian philosopher Vilhelmas Storosta-Vydūnas initiated a revival of the old Lithuanian faith, and dissatisfaction with Lithuania's Oststaat status started to rise. These nationalists started to rally around the Party of National Progress (TPP) - a minor nationalist party founded in 1916 and led by Antanas Smetona, one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, who ended up sidelined after independence due to his conflict with the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn 1928, upon the death of Mindaugas II, Lithuanian nationalists sought to take advantage of the disorder and seize Vilnius and Klaipėda. The attack on Vilnius never took place, while the one on Klaipėda became known as the 'Memel Uprising' or 'Memel Massacre', resulting in the death of 50 armed militiamen at the hands of the German garrison. Smetona distanced himself from the uprising, the TPP dissolved under the public backlash and reformed to the Nationalist Union (LTS), while the event became a rallying moment for Lithuanian nationalism.\n\nNowadays, Lithuanian nationalists remain split between two approaches. Those rallied around Antanas Smetona and the 'moderate' LTS believe that it is possible to achieve a second National Revival through democratic means. Others have become disillusioned with what they perceive as a sham, however. Uniting the most radical and extreme strands of Lithuanian nationalism is the informal movement known as the Activist Front (LAF)."
 LIT.2.a:0 "Encore..."

 LIT.3.t:0 "Le Gouvernement de Leonas Bistras"
 LIT.3.d:0 "Representing the Christian Democrats (LKDP), Leonas Bistras is the fifth Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lithuania, appointed after the election of 1933. A doctor by profession, Bistras is an active member and chairman of the Party and, as expected of the Christian Democrats, a devout Catholic. Since the beginning of his term, Lithuania has experienced economic growth thanks to growth in Germany and Lithuania's close ties to its economy, as well as education reforms. This economic growth means that the Bistras cabinet is confident in its stability enough to consider projects once seen as nothing but impossible dreams, such as acquiring Lithuania's own port or organising land reform.\n\nDespite this, it is expected that this will be the last time the Christian Democrats head a majority government alone. Minority parties, such as the Committee of Poles in Lithuania (LLK) and the Jewish Labour Bund (Bundas), are growing stronger, and so are the Social Democrats (LSDP), having recovered their strength after the slump in the 1920s. Finally, the growth of Lithuanian nationalism has culminated in the Nationalist Union (LTS) becoming a serious challenge to the establishment. Though dismissed as a party of violent radicals, their leader, Antanas Smetona, is committed to achieving his vision through democratic means.\n\nWith the planet drawing closer to... something, it remains to be seen where Lithuania shall turn."

Cela a encore aggravé les tensions entre les communautés polonaise et juive lituanienne au sein de la ville. Cela est dû au fait que les entreprises juives ont pu résister aux effets du Lundi Noir en raison de leur communauté très unie et de leurs affiliations au Front juif polonais. En conséquence, de nombreuses entreprises polonaises ont fait faillite et, dans certains cas, ont été rachetées par leurs homologues juifs, ce qui fut ressenti comme un deuxième traumatisme.\n\nBeaucoup se sont tournés vers Stanisław Narutowicz, le chef du Comité des Polonais lituaniens, cherchant désespérément un réconfort face à cette situation. Après une courte réunion, Narutowicz avec d'autres dirigeants polonais lituaniens ont déclaré qu'ils devraient se tourner vers Vilnius pour obtenir du soutien, ce qui pourrait signifier une réduction de l'autonomie dans la région."

Now a second split is occurring with the Litvaks (Lithuanian Jews) and Polish Jews in Białystok butting heads over the direction of the Bund. The Litvak community generally wish to promote the Nation with a Nation idea and there are those who wish to be become more politically active as opposed to the Polish Jews, with Zionism gaining traction amongst its community and the promotion of Hebrew over Yiddish. With the no common ground to be found between the two groups, the Bund has further fragmented between those in the South and those in the North."

 LIT.11.d:0 "The Black Monday and the ensuing economic crisis has left the country completely unprepared. The government of Leonas Bistras operated with the belief that the Tirpitz golden era will outlast them, and thus did not build up a sufficient money reserve to counter the crisis. An emergency session of the cabinet has been summoned to consider all possible solutions for recovery.\n\nThe summit has sharpened the long present divisions within the Christian Democrats. A growing wing of the party finds itself enthralled by the ideas proposed by the professor and Christian ideologue Stasys Šalkauskis, a proponent of democratic corporatism and federal devolution of the Kingdom. This 'Federalist' wing believes that assuring autonomy from the German markets and rallying the trust of the people in corporate economics can help weather the crisis.\n\nPrime Minister Bistras is not willing to throw the Germans under the bus, however. He and the old guard of the party have instead drawn up a series of initiatives known as the 'Galvanauskas Plan', named after our Minister of Finance. This plan involves the development of a sustained industrial heartland in Vilnius and Kaunas and bailing out the worst off of the German Junkers to keep foreign capital flowing into the country.\n\nThe announcement of this plan has not resonated well with the Lithuanian people, however. The inhabitants of the Southern regions, so-called 'Outer Lithuania', protest this abandonment, and so do the Social Democrats and the Nationalist Union. In their eyes, this reliance on German investors is what caused the crisis in the first place. The first results of the injected surplus seem to be positive, however."

In Vilnius, several of the most notable companies have been purchased by Jewish business owners, unions and worker cooperatives, many of them in cooperation with Lithuanian and Polish entrepreneurs. The Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, wielding its influence within the community and especially among Jewish labour unions, several of whom it directly operates, helped orchestrate these buyouts. Native companies in Kaunas and Białystok, Lithuanian and Polish respectively, have begun buying out former German assets at a low price, seeking to wrest control of the market from German competitors after having been suppressed for many years by not so clean business practices.\n\nThe transition has been far from soft, however. Thousands of workers in Lithuanian cities have been laid off and are starting to radicalise. The local companies organise these buyouts with pretty much all of the remaining assets they have, leaving their future uncertain - and, in fact, many of these freshly established cooperatives and companies are reported to declare bankruptcy in the following weeks. Should we cling onto our guns, our economy will go through this transition and come out more independent - however, when it is so painful and so difficult, will we even be able to weather the storm?"

Radically-minded members of the legislature called for distributing the land to the poor and the landless, and this measure was even endorsed by several members of the Christian Democrats, such as Mykolas Krupavičius, who saw this as a way to stifle the growth of socialism among the peasantry. Ultimately, however, no consensus was reached and many of the abandoned manors were bought out by Germans at a low price. Large agribusinesses established themselves in the Lithuanian countryside, causing resentment among the landless peasantry and even serving as a way for some German families to settle down in Lithuanian territory.\n\nBlack Monday has changed the situation in the countryside, however. Many of the formerly thriving conglomerates are now desperately trying to sell their land, even at the lowest possible price, and pull out from the country to save operations in their homeland. This presents an opportunity for the Lithuanian government to step in, buy out the land and ensure a fairer distribution of land ownership in the countryside."

Younger, more active and frustrated members of the Party have taken matters into their own hands, however, and started organising mass protest rallies across cities such as Kaunas, Šiauliai and Vilnius.\n\nTheir anti-semitism is thinly-veiled, if hidden at all - these nationalists call for a 'Lithuania for Lithuanians' and their marches, more often than not, devolve into violence, such as vandalism of German or Jewish owned shop fronts or, in some cases, direct assault against peaceful citizens. The following sparked a harsh reaction from the Constabularies - several of the most radical activists were detained, while additional police officers were dispatched to ensure order in the cities.\n\nImmediately upon the conclusion of this nationalist fever, eyes were turned towards the leaders of the Nationalist Union, Antanas Smetona and Augustinas Voldemaras. Both of them handled the situation tactfully, however. Smetona publicly denounced the actions of what he described as 'loose cannons barely affiliated with his party'. Voldemaras was under police investigation due to suspicions of having a hand in these actions, but they were cut short and Voldemaras himself expressed his support for the stance of his party's leader."

Despite his advanced age, Antanas Smetona has been campaigning everywhere from Palanga to Vilnius, and so have all of his underlings, each of them offering an alternative to Syndicalism and Christian conservatism alike, a strong, national rule, free from the shackles of foreigners, a chance for Lithuania to carve its own fate.

The agreement also stipulates harsh restrictions on the types of production which are allowed to be traded through the ports, and several types of tolls. Ultimately, it means that Lithuanian foreign trade is severely restricted and reliant on the German whim.\n\nOne of the campaign promises of Leonas Bistras and the LKDP was to re-negotiate the agreement and 'carve Lithuania out a window to the West', and now they are ready to act upon this promise. Palanga, Lithuania's sole town on the coast of the Baltic Sea, holds the potential of becoming an adequate port, if only the Germans allow to ease restrictions on local docks and shipbuilding.

This has culminated in an official agreement between the LSDP and the Bundas. The Bundas has offered its funds to the Social Democrat campaign and agreed to a coalition ticket - several Jewish labour leaders shall stand under the Social Democratic Banner in their constituencies, and all Lithuanian Jews are encouraged to support this joint ticket in the next elections.\n\nThough the right wing has begun crying out about 'Jewish syndicalist infiltration of the LSDP', they can only concede that the leader of the Social Democrats, Steponas Kairys, has made a yet another successful move."

Bistras tried to defend himself to the best of his ability - and, ultimately, as a sudden new speaker declared, the blame rests on everyone's shoulders. Decades of unchallenged leadership have left the party complacent and unwilling to present something anew.\n\nThis speaker was Stasys Šalkauskis, a Lithuanian professor and ideologue, the founder of democratic, federal corporatism in Lithuania, which he dubs the 'Optimal System'. Though he has only been a member of the party for a few years and only entered politics recently, he had already gathered a strong base of support from young, active members of the party. Šalkauskis presented the tenets of his program, calling for a corporatist, integral economical and political system, and reconciliation with Lithuania's numerous ethnic groups under a federal democratic government. The ultimate goal of the 'Optimal System' would be a nation where all of its members can live up to Christian teaching and values, where everyone's voice is heard in the government and where everyone knows they contribute to a greater whole.\n\nLacking the stamina or the charisma to try to sway the mass of the party back to the old guard, Bistras opted to concede, allowing Šalkauskis to speak for the duration of the meeting."

Stanisław Narutowicz has received a personal phone call from Steponas Kairys, the leader of the LSDP, offering cooperation in the electoral campaign and a coalition afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Christian Democrats have not been any less active in enticing the Polish vote. Now led by Stasys Šalkauskis, they reach out to several high ranking members among the party, explaining their program of federalisation and offering autonomy greater than the Social Democrats could ever promise.

Their role has mostly been limited to actions such as crowdfunding, public support, and minor support roles such as cooking and nursery. Now that the Riflemen Union is being integrated into the greater framework of the armed forces, and public attitude in our society slowly starting to change, Lithuanian women have not been forgotten and are no longer going to be limited to such minor roles. Under the advice of Chief of Staff Stasys Raštikis, the LŠS has formed additional women's auxiliary units and expanded their listing of roles for women in the organisation. Though they are still not allowed to hold rifles and march alongside men, they can work in field hospitals, as mechanics and technicians, staff in signal and logistics companies, and similar non-combat support positions. This decision has not been universally accepted however, and there've been murmurs among older, conservative officers about allowing the other sex closer to the battlefield."

Of course, this would come with its own hurdles, as Gustaitis is attached to the newly formed Lithuanian Airforce as opposed to the Army - but this is nothing new in military history, with even the concept of the 'Marine' being a new thought for some.

Right now, the royal family of Lithuania resides in Verkiai Palace to the north of Vilnius, and though it is more than adequate for a monarch, the King has offered his services to the nation by designing a reconstruction of the Palace of the Grand Dukes - with an Art Deco touch, of course.\n\nThough the Palace is a famous relic of Lithuanian history, the Kingdom's resources are far from infinite, thus a debate has broken out between the King and his government on its study, size and feasibility."

The church survived many of the disasters and occupations that betide Vilnius, though it appears it couldn't survive the ruling of the Russian Tsars with an order for it to be demolished in 1877.

What they got to their surprise was a King, who was firm in the belief that a monarch is there to serve his people. and one that learned the language and traditions of his land. Though he was still a puppet King, he ensured that Berlin's interference in Lithuania was a minimal, with one act being his support Vilnius being declared as a 'Development City', in an attempt to curb the German dominance on his Kingdom.\n\nThe few vices of the late King was his unwavering views on tradition and royal protocols. This was famously proven when Mindaugas refused to accept his son's engagement to a woman beneath his status, resulting in Wilhelm abdicating the throne, and Karl Gero being trusted as the heir apparent to a Kingdom he knew little of. Unlike his brother, Karl had no wish to guide a nation, but wished to design buildings having finished his studies as an architect.

He had to abandon his studies early due to financial problems, and three of his four children passed away in the same year. In 1844, he published the first of his poems, 'Pocztylion', under the pen name 'Władysław Syrokomla', a name he took from his family's coat of arms. Eventually, he rose to become the editor of the Kurier Wilenski, the largest and most prestigious Polish language in the Vilnius area. However, after taking part in an anti-tsarist demonstration in 1861, he was arrested by the Russian Okhrana and sentenced to house arrest - dying a year later, virtually penniless.\n\nHeavily influenced by fellow Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, Syrokomla's poems dealt with the liberation of peasants and the dream of a free Polish-Lithuania. While he wrote in Polish, he acknowledged himself as Lithuanian as his birthplace was located in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also wrote several poems in Belarusian due to his fascination with the society and culture of 19th century Belarus.

 LIT.100.t:0 "The Optimal System"
 LIT.100.d:0 "The political views of Stasys Šalkauskis stem from his Christian upbringing and his experience of both 'Western' and 'Eastern' culture. Having studied in Moscow and Friburg alike, he came to view Lithuania as a fusion of 'rational' Western culture and 'emotional' Eastern culture, believing both of these rudiments to be equally important and Lithuania as something unique in the world history. It is a bridge between East and West, a nation which is able to manifest the best features of them both, if only its cultural and political system is reformed to optimally draw out these rudiments and create a truly pluralistic, democratic state.\n\nŠalkauskis has been a maverick in Lithuanian politics for as long as he has participated in them. Though a believer in social justice and a harsh opponent of free market capitalism, he denounced socialism as demagogic and atomistic, and based his beliefs in Christian compassion and solidarity rather than revolutionary thought. He believed his fellow Christian Democrats to be 'inquisitioners', rather than politicians, too. In his eyes, Christian democracy should carefully weigh the balance between individualism and socialism (which he saw as a reaction to individualism, i.e. capitalism) and draw out the benefits of them both - and the way to do so is through federal corporatism.\n\nLike many Christian politicians, Šalkauskis believed in economic corporatism. The entire country needs to be organised into economic, cultural, political and spiritual corporations - and these corporations unite into even greater units, federations. These federations would work autonomously, resolving social issues amongst themselves without the need for extensive government involvement. Politically, these federations would manifest as autonomous Lithuanian, Belarusian, Polish and Jewish entities within a united Kingdom; economically - as federations of trade unions and chambers of commerce; spiritually and culturally - as a universal belief in Christian ethics and compassion, serving as the strings which knit the society together. It should be noted that Šalkauskis did not believe in the imposition of Christianity over Lithuania's non-Christian subjects, such as Jews - in his eyes, Christian ethics, such as those professed in the Decalogue, are universal amongst all humans, even if they carry different names in different religions."

Some overblow the Lithuanian population, some Polish, some Belarusian, and the reason is that because previous censuses in Lithuanian territory were inaccurate, prone to nationalist fact-twisting and uncertainties regarding certain nationalities. A new census is thus planned to take place and settle all debates once and for all.\n\nThe Lithuanian census of [GetYear] can be organised swiftly, allowing the government to quickly move on with the issue and start on other projects in the Optimal System plan, or we can take our time to make sure the data is as accurate as it can possibly be."

The drive towards federalism forces us to reconsider our approach to language education.\n\nPrime Minister Šalkauskis's dream would be to have each student in the country, Lithuanian, Slavic or other, to learn Lithuanian and one Slavic language of choice, to allow interconnection between the Kingdom's population - but German authorities continue to enforce mandatory German language education for all students, and loading them with three mandatory languages to learn would be horrifying.

It manifests itself in the form of mass protests, vandalism, or even outright assaults against political opponents. Several skirmishes between armed nationalists and police forces have been registered across the country, resulting in dozens wounded and the country shackled by terror.\n\nIt is believed that this violent activism is the work of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), an underground organisation of Lithuanian nationalists seeking to free Lithuania from any and all foreign influence."

This speech has been broadcasted through radio across much of Białystok Region, and it seems that many of those listening to him express support to his atomising ideas.\n\nPerhaps it should be no surprise, given that Kościałkowski is a notable Polish irredentist and has gotten into trouble with the authorities over his anti-Lithuanian remarks before, but it should also be noted that our census has sparked Polish resentment which Kościałkowski simply used to his advantage..."

The philosopher vehemently denies this as an attempt to grant the monarchy stronger executive powers, however, citing that his belief is that the monarch must be an apolitical unifying figure first and foremost. Needless to say, this question in the project has yet to be resolved, and this has led to people like Antanas Maceina interpreting the idea as necessitating vast executive powers, even undemocratic ones.\n\nKing Vytautas II and the cabinet of ministers have been discussing this dilemma, however, and as the Optimal System project is coming to a close, he is willing to present the results of their compromise in a speech to the nation."

In a move unforeseen by observers and the press, the king has decided to meet with the Smetona regarding the future of Lithuania's leadership. There are heated tensions on both sides, especially since Smetona will undoubtedly demand power for himself and his party, and few expect an actual compromise to be made.

The first priority of the Nationalist Union in the economic department is to enact sweeping land reform, requisitioning unused land and setting maximum limits to the amount of land one person might own, and distributing government land to the landless and those who own very little land. Unlike the land reform plans proposed by the Social Democrats, however, Smetona's 'national land reform' has a political bent as well. Priority to distributing government land goes to Lithuanian speaking farmers, while non-Lithuanians such as Poles and Belarusians are not prioritised, and, even if they do receive scraps, this land is usually granted deep in Lithuanian-speaking territory, as an attempt to force more non-Lithuanians to move northwards and start assimilating them.

On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the Lithuanian nationalism which courses through the LTS's veins is deeply tied to anti-semitism. Lithuanian nationalists hate the fact that Jewish entrepreneurs are dominating the market, and even their mere presence is too much to bear for some of the radical of the nationalists. Smetona does not support this blatant antisemitism, but looking at the Lithuanian Jewry, he sees something which he can agree is only a threat - the Jewish Labour Bund.\n\nVictor Alter, the leader of the Lithuanian Bundas, has received a private visit from the Prime Minister, where he explained his point of view on the organisation - in of itself, it is a necessary evil, and there are many things which Lithuanians can learn from the productivity and unity of the Labour Bund - however, to tolerate its existence, there are reforms which he needs to undertake. As a show of force, Smetona's right hand man, Augustinas Voldemaras, rallied the paramilitary of the Nationalist Union, the National Guard 'Geležinis Vilkas', to organise loud mass protests surrounding the headquarters of the Bundas, complete with strike teams of armed junior officers ready to burst in at a moment's notice.

Many of Lithuania's leading nationalist figures, such as Jonas Basanavičius and Vincas Kudirka, hail from this region, and even the Lithuanian language has been standardised according to the 'Zanavykai' dialect in northern Suvalkija. However, throughout the 19th century, Polish influence continued to encroach on the region, and towns that were once a core part of Lithuanian culture, such as Sejny/Seinai, have become bilingual or even Polish-dominant.\n\nSince the formation of the Kingdom of Lithuania, the Suwałki electoral districts have been safe constituencies for the Committee of Poles in Lithuania, as their Lithuanian competitors are divided by ideological grounds and could not field a significant challenge. Polish dominated local assemblies have been imposing education in their language, maintain ties with other Polish communities and thus foster the slow Polonisation of the region. Now that the Committee has been broken apart, however, Antanas Smetona's government sees an opportunity.\n\nIt may be possible to orchestrate the formation of a united Lithuanian electoral list in the Suwałki region, which would take advantage of the disunity among the Polish community and retake control of the local assemblies. If a Lithuanian local government is installed this way, not only will it be able to impose policies more acceptable to us, such as Lithuanian language education, funding for Lithuanian communities, and incentives for colonists from the north - but it will also be more loyal to us, allowing us to erode the autonomy of the region.

Land clearance in the region has allowed families from the north to move in and establish themselves, and significant modernisation programs have been imposed in the education system, reforming the schooling program to one more in line with ethnic Lithuania.

 LIT.159.d:0 "Traditionally, all the constituent units of Lithuania have had a sizeable degree of autonomy regarding the education system and especially languages taught as part of the education program. The reforms of Leonas Bistras' government in the early 1930s saw this devolved system streamlined in order to create some semblance of uniformity between schools - for example, creating separate categories of schools depending on the language used for education. However, a much autonomy was kept regardless. One of Antanas Smetona's primary talking points as leader of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union was to put an end to this system and put education in Lithuania solely under the control of the central government.\n\nThe Nationalist Union has lodged a bill in the Seimas which has been simply dubbed as 'Language Reform Law'. The primary goals of the project are to eliminate most of the 'school categories' created by the Leonas Bistras government and put most schools in Lithuania under a unified education program, especially language education. All schools falling under the 'standard' school category would be required to teach Lithuanian and German to all students, and hire native speakers for the former subject - this includes schools in so-called 'Outer Lithuanian' territories, majority Polish and Belarusian regions. The Language Reform Law also includes several other streamlining education reforms unrelated to language.\n\nAnd, of course, it is stapled alongside a bill on the increase of funding for orphanages in the Vilnius region, in order to make sure that any opponent thinks twice about voting against this law and thus making poor children in Vilnius cry. This is good, because this law has a lot of opponents."

Once the newspaper of the Party of National Progress, it took a different turn after the Memel Uprising, under the leadership of the journalist and poet Vytautas Alantas.\n\nAlantas and his clique of supporters, such as Jonas Statkus and Domas Cesevičius, believe that it is not enough to simply assert Lithuanian superiority in our nation. The Lithuanian culture itself must be purified and unwanted foreign influences within it must be removed - for it was this inability to purify which led to Lithuania becoming a slave to Poland, then to Russia, and finally Germany. It is even more extreme in its nationalist stances than even the most radical leaders of the Nationalist Union - it has no desire to even pay lip service to democracy, its hatred towards any ethnic minorities in Lithuania is unprecedented... however, they cheer for Smetona and his goals of strong leadership nonetheless, seeing it as a step in the right direction.\n\nIn his most recent work, 'Žygiuojanti Lietuva' ('Marching Lithuania'), Alantas hails Smetona's government, yet at the same time declares that it needs radical reforms. His primary talking point is Christianity, which Alantas does not hide his disdain of. Describing it as an unwanted, destructive influence imposed upon Lithuania by foreign powers, he calls for Smetona's government to break up the influence of clericalism, abandon its pretenses of democracy and embrace the ideals of pagan humanism, a return to the metaphysical of our forefathers, and selfless sacrifice to one's country.

Throughout the last sixteen years, this united front of Polish minority candidates has had complete control over their respective regions - however, it is a brittle political party and its influence over the Polish minority is not immovable.\n\nIdeological divisions in the KPL/LLK have plagued it since its earliest days - Stanisław Narutowicz, the respected longtime leader of the party, is socially liberal and leaning towards socialism in economic matters, whereas several of his deputy leaders and fresh members steer significantly to the right, maintaining close ties with right-wing Polish parties such as the Endecja and Chadecja. For Smetona, this was a fertile ground to break up his opposition. Narutowicz was the easiest to bend - the two of them knew each other from the days of the Council of Lithuania, and the elderly politician eventually bent under pressure and agreed to enter a political pact of 'non-aggression' with the LTS. This immediately caused massive rifts within the Committee, leading to the formation of two new political parties - 'Christian Democracy of Poles in Lithuania' and Marian Zyndram-Kościałkowski's irredentist 'Polish Electoral Action'.\n\nAt the same time, the Seimas successfully approved plans for the creation of a Southern Lithuania Development Fund, giving the central government in Vilnius a say in investment and development in Polish majority regions, allowing them to fund communities and schools supportive of their goals and breaking up the hegemony of the Committee in local affairs.

His opponents immediately took this as a prediction that Kairys will try to stay in power as long as his health allows it - in truth, however, what he was referring to was the structural reforms which he and his party hoped to undertake.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party of Lithuania professes the ideal of National Personal Autonomy. First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austromarxist movement, which the LSDP borrows most of its ideas from - what it seeks to achieve is to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but instead a simple association of persons, disjoining the state from its territory. After all, what says that, to be a Lithuanian, you need to live specifically in this plot in Europe and follow a specific set of traditions? As long as you believe yourself to be Lithuanian, hold Lithuanian citizenship, and contribute to the nation, either through taxes or through other ways, what stops you from being considered Lithuanian?\n\nA similar view was espoused by many Bundist Jewish ideologists and thus turned the Social Democrats and the Bundas into natural allies. During their term, the government of Prime Minister Steponas Kairys will seek to undertake significant reforms to achieve their ideal of National Personal Autonomy. Each ethnic group in Lithuania will have their own universal cultural assemblies, with the ability to levy their own taxes and autonomously decide on matters pertaining to their members. Every citizen of the Kingdom would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no authority would have any control over his decision.\n\nOf course, these reforms will coincide with LSDP's other policy programs, such as a swift establishment of a welfare system and taking out the right-wing opposition, mostly through legal methods."

The moderate members of the cabinet believe that soft measures such as rescinding state funding for the Catholic Church and strictly enforcing political neutrality should cut it, especially since much of the countryside is still deeply religious and would not take a state conflict with the Church well.

Not because this hope could be miscalculated or wrong, but because the Lithuanian workers need to first be able to trust each other and forge their own future. The events of the last decade only remind us that only those proletarian victories are permanent which the people managed to not just acquire, but to maintain.\n\nThe working class in Lithuania will only be able to take over and establish socialism when the economic conditions of the country place us to proletarian lines or tie the majority of the population to them, when this majority becomes a willing supporter of the socialist agenda.'\n\nThese are words written by Steponas Kairys in 1929, defining and specifying the ultimate goal of the Social Democratic Party - democratic socialism.

Economic regulations and taxes here are loose, but the bankruptcy or evacuation of our German investors means that a gaping hole has been left in the city's economy. Companies owned by the Bundas and local Lithuanian investors alike have been trying to fill up that gap as much as they can, and both of them protest the pro-German rules and regulations still present.

The Iron Wolf's vision of a perfect Lithuanian state has been best expressed by one of the organisation's chief ideologues, cavalry officer Juozas Tomkus, in the underground newspaper 'Tautos kelias'. The Weltkrieg and the years after have proven two things - that all wars from here on out will be won by not just arms and regular troops, but the mobilisation of the entire nation for war; and that Lithuania is destined to end up at war eventually, and anyone foolish enough to believe that these are times of peace has no place in the country. The only way for Lithuania to survive is for it to become an army - from the man in the front to the woman in the back, from the professor in the laboratories and worker in the factories, every single person and every single resource must be dedicated to national defence. Every single Lithuanian must be trained to wield a weapon and know his place in the armed nation. Such a nation will be completely unassailable and impossible to destroy."

Striking the base foolishly, the defenders fired from fortified sandbag positions and towers, picking off the LAF forces like fish in a barrel. Finally, after substantial casualties, the LAF fled for the woods once more but not before leaving behind their wounded and fallen comrades.

Most of whom initially panicked, the loyalist defenders began a courageous defence using the depot's light machine guns to suppress the enemy. However, the LAF insurgents had vanished deep into the Knyszyn Forest despite their valiant attempts, and the defenders were too exhausted to pursue them.

However, the cry for help did not fall onto deaf ears, and the alarm reached a local garrison of Lithuanian military that arrived in the town at once. After an intense firefight on the city streets and the LAF fled, but the damage had been done. Houses, shops, and businesses were targeted in the orgy of violence, and although the military has restored order, the incident has most certainly unnerved many Lithuanians.

Especially Maceina's 'Crypto-Bolsheviks' have drawn the ire of Voldemaras' Wolves, going as far to open skirmishes during the Battle of Vilnius. Alantas' group, being smaller than the Wolves but having perhaps even more radical thought, has been wary of Voldemaras' intentions of taking control of the national renewal, with fears that he will use his advantage to crush his so-called 'allies' before they can move on him - like any of the three would, if they could.\n\nUnder this backdrop of paranoia, the secret meeting between Alantas and Maceina has taken place in one of their hideouts in the outskirts of Vilnius: and the subject of the meeting is no other than high treason.

The loss of the man who turned the group of activists into true, national revolution, is tremendous to the spirit of his followers, who have started debate to find a worthy successor for the Iron Wolf. Despite cries to find leader among themselves, even the idealists have to admit that two other men left of the LAF leadership, Vytautas Alantas and Antanas Maceina, are perhaps the only two people who can lead the existential battle.\n\nThe debate is bitter - Maceina believes in the eventual destruction of the bourgeoisie, the strength and renewal of the Lithuanian worker, and the end to social and economic injustice. To Maceina, capitalism is the very reason for Lithuania's moral and economic decay, and only through the Church and Lithuanian culture will Lithuania find its path once more. On the other hand, Alantas believes that Lithuania must return to its folk origins, to the days of the ancestors' gods and that the church is nothing more than foreign interference in the history and culture of Lithuania. Alantas believes that society must be heavily militarised, but his stance on economics is far more liberal than the radical distribution of wealth advocated by Maceina. Both men agree that Lithuanian society must be one for and run by Lithuanians only - but it seems that it's rapidly becoming the only thing they agree on.\n\nAfter hours of speeches and politicking, Alantas has finally snapped and denounced Maceina as nothing more than a socialist agent, turncloak who arranged the assassination of Voldemaras. Maceina's answer was equally harsh, describing Alantas as nothing more than a man with dictatorial ambitions who plans to destroy the Church in Lithuania.

In the mock of a trial, it is revealed that Maceina was conspiring to murder the one, true leader of Lithuania - and these revelations come from none other than Alantas, who has shared his account of the shadowy negotiations of treason Maceina initiated. There was never any doubt of the verdict - the jury picked by Voldemaras has declared Maceina and his organisation enemies of the state, sentenced to death by firing squad. After the gunshots sent one of the three to meet his dear Maker, Voldemaras turns to his remaining co-ruler, Alantas, whose involvement in the conspiracy is still seem shady by many. Voldemaras gives him simple choice - to recognise Voldemaras as the sole and sovereign ruler of Lithuania like any loyal follower should, or face trial for his part in so-called Maceina Affair. Practically at gunpoint, Alantas realises having been played into corner and gives in - and thus Voldemaras has secured his position in one fell swoop, and the Iron Wolves are ready to serve their Tautos Vadas."

These attacks have become more frequent and more daring in recent days, as our critically-stretched police force struggles to prevent attacks even in towns and cities where Jews are the largest ethnic group.\n\nOur inability to protect the Jewish population has left the Jewish Labour Bund deeply furious - as a precondition for their support of Narutowicz's government, Victor Alter and the rest of the Bundas leadership has demanded that something be done to address the terror against Lithuania's Jews. Narutowicz has agreed that the current situation cannot stand, and has spent a long night attempting to reach an agreement on a solution. The most obvious and direct answer to the problem is to further expand the nation's constabularies, hopefully providing them with the shot in the arm needed to hamstring the LAF's ability to target Jewish communities. However, some radical Bundas members aren't content with this solution - they complain that the constabularies, even with extra support, are in practice only able to react with various amounts of delay to LAF attacks, and in some cases may be prone to anti-Semetic thinking themselves. Their alternative proposal is to allow Jewish communities to form their own police forces, which they argue will be more responsive and effective at keeping thse communities safe.\n\nThis counteroffer is highly controversial for several reasons - not least because it places these Jewish police units as a parallel entity to the government and largely outside its control, and may be interpreted as a concession on the part of the government that it can't protect all of its citizens, regardless of how true that may or may not be. However, while much of the police insists that the extra resources will be enough to get a handle on LAF activity, some admit that structural inefficiencies are limiting their effectiveness and that throwing more money at the problem will only go so far. Either way, the support of the Bundas is crucial - and so, a decision must be made."

Given his influence in Lithuanian politics as well as his Polish identity, Narutowicz has long served as head of the KPL/LLK since the early 1920s. However, with the rise of ethnic tensions surfacing in Lithuania once again, the right-wing of the KPL and the LLK have seen a rise in popularity.

Furthermore, many have begun to view themselves as 'Litvins', an archaic Slavic term for citizens from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

It is a distant eastern suburb of our capital, Vilnius, inhabited almost completely by Polish and Russian minorities. Traditionally, even the Committee of Lithuanian Poles has hesitated to challenge Alseika in his constituency, as the humble, soft-spoken doctor was beloved by people of all ethnicity in the suburb. With his passing, however, it has enthusiastically put forward Jan Piłsudski, brother of the famous hero of the Polish people in the Weltkrieg, as their candidate. Unsurprisingly, he is supported by an absolute majority of the Polish-speaking population, while the Lithuanian parties in the Seimas fear the lockdown of yet another safe KPL constituency.\n\nA plan has been proposed in the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party to prevent this fate from befalling the Naujoji Vilnia constituency. While it should not be allowed to redraw constituency borders so close to the date of the election, it is not 'illegal' per se, and the idea is to carefully carve out new borders for the constituency, including non-Polish neighbourhoods in the constituency to balance out the Polish vote. At the same time, a smear campaign will make sure that the Belarusians, Russians and Lithuanians do not cast a single vote for Piłsudski, which should ensure a victory for the Christian Democratic candidate, Antanas Šmulkštys.

For the following year, all government officials, bureaucrats and pensioners are required by law to purchase a specified amount of geese, depending on one's ranking within the bureaucratic apparatus and wage, at a minimum of one. As proof of goose transaction, all farmers selling these birds have been required to sell them with numbered cards, which would then be turned in to the government by the person purchasing geese.\n\nAlthough certainly an unorthodox way to solve the economic ills of the country, it has actually paid off somewhat.

He believed rational science, metaphysics and Christian ideology to all stem from the same source, the divine Logos, and thus a good Christian should seek a unity of theological, philosophical and scientific knowledge. This drive for unity should reflect itself in society - Jakštas advocated for amending the Schism and restoring a single, universal Christian church, he believed that class warfare should be replaced by class cooperation, driven by Christian ethics, and he was the first in Lithuania to introduce the idea of the United States of Europe, which his home country Lithuania should champion and join. He was an internationalist - he believed that 'open-minded and open-hearted people' who would support these ideas exist in every country, repressed by the ignorance of the masses, and should they join a single worldwide organisation, they would be able to guide the world towards the absolute Truth and absolute Good.\n\nPerhaps because of this reason, Jakštas has had a deep interest in Esperanto ever since its creation, and chaired the Esperanto Federation of Lithuania until his death, believing it to be an important step towards his internationalist ideals."

It is widely considered to be a seminal event in the growth of the Lithuanian National Revival, as it was started with nationalist intentions in mind - to improve the economy and people of the country, to promote Catholic ideals, and to stand against a prevailing Tsarist policy to turn a blind eye towards alcoholism, in order to keep the populace intoxicated and thus easy to control.\n\nThe priesthood of Kaunas refounded the temperance movement in 1908, in the form of the Lithuanian Catholic Temperance Brotherhood. Since then, it has been an important mass movement and pressure group in Lithuanian politics, uniting over sixty thousand members as well as maintaining close alliances with other Lithuanian religious organisations. An idea has been raised to promote this Brotherhood further and use it as a tool to indoctrinate the populace with Christian ethics and beliefs, temperance being one of them."

Centuries of cultural proximity and unity under a single nation have left many Belarusian-speaking peoples, especially aristocrats and intellectuals, identifying with Lithuania as their homeland, seeing it not as a nation-state, but as a multicultural union of various nations, cultures and languages. These people are known as Litvins.\n\nMany people in the Vilnius region, especially the poorest peasantry and proletarians, do not define themselves with any specific nation at all. Living in such a hub of numerous languages and cultures, they do not consider themselves to be a part of any one, speak a mix of Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish lingo known as 'mowa prosta' and are known as Tutejszy, or 'locals', as they would declare their nationality to be in census data.\n\nFor the longest time, Lithuanian censuses have defined peoples by their native language and avoided the nationality question entirely for this specific reason, but because of internal pressure to start including nationality in census data, we will have to decide on how we wish to treat Litvins, Tutejszy and other difficult ethnic groups."

During his forty years of life, Kudirka accomplished much in the name of the Lithuanian nation, most notably writing the hymn 'Tautiška giesmė', which has since become the national anthem of Lithuania. Unlike his fellow patriarch of the National Revival, Jonas Basanavičius, Vincas Kudirka had a much more defined political program. He believed that patriotism alone would not be able to revive the Lithuanian nation, thus it was the duty of their generation to educate the Lithuanian peasantry, improve their lives and fight in the name of social justice. Though he passed away in 1899, before the independence of Lithuania could be established, his thought has had a profound impact on Lithuania since. It is said that Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas, a famous leader of Lithuanian radical socialists, chose his alias in honour of Kudirka - Kudirka's pen name was 'Kapsas', while Mickevičius was only 'Kapsukas', meaning 'little Kapsas'. On the other side of the political spectrum, right-wing Lithuanian nationalists also claim his memory for themselves, they note his stance against Polonisation and nationalist outlook.\n\nIn honour of this anniversary, a statue for Vincas Kudirka, designed by the sculptor Vincas Grybas, is planned to be erected in Vilnius.

Though traditionally seen as a Polish uprising against Tsarist rule, it gained significant traction in Lithuania as well, where it coincided with peasant unrest over an unsatisfactory abolition of serfdom. It is considered to be a turning point in Lithuanian history - while the uprising in Lithuania still hoped to join Poland in a federation, the Lithuanian National Revival which sparked in the years after finally disjoined Lithuanian national identity from that of Poland, and turned these nations from comrades into enemies. Antanas Mackevičius and other Lithuanian members of the January Uprising, while still supporters of a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, had a far more concise national identity than their brethren in the decades beforehand. At the same time, the uprising fought for social justice, the rights of the peasantry, and other radical ideas, which has made it an inspiration for the Lithuanian socialist movement in the years after.\n\nIn an independent Lithuania, the November and January Uprisings are most commemorated by Polish Lithuanians, as a means of expressing the centuries long connection between the Polish and Lithuanian nations. Now, they seek to fund a memorial in Krekenava, which, alongside Mackevičius, would also commemorate other leaders of the uprising in Lithuania, such as Zigmantas Sierakauskas and Konstantinas Kalinauskas.

It was the first Constitution published in the Old World, and while it only lasted in effect for less than a year, it has had a profound impact on the political thought in the region, being the culmination of Enlightenment thought in Poland-Lithuania. However, while it is unquestionably important in Polish historical memory, it does not hold the same respect among Lithuanians. After all, it was the same Constitution that sought to abolish the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and establish the unitary Kingdom of Poland in its wake - and while this was prevented with the Reciprocal Guarantee of the Two Nations a few months after, it does not change the fact that this Constitution is seen as something 'foreign', rather than something 'Lithuanian' as much as it is 'Polish'.\n\nRegardless, the pressure to recognise May 3rd as a commemorated date remains.

The ideals of this movement are most expressed in the works and activities of Antanas Maceina, culminating in him and many of his peers publishing the manifesto of the Young Catholic movement, 'Į organišką valstybę' ('To an Organic State')\n\nThe primary enemy of the Young Catholic movement is social and economic injustice, spurred by Distributist influence, and in their manifesto, Maceina calls for radical land reform, redistribution of wealth and the uprooting of 'bourgeois-liberal thought' from the Lithuanian identity. Even the Catholic Church would not be safe from redistribution - after all, one can worship Christ without gold and silk, so why should the Church hold onto its wealth when there is so much suffering they could alleviate? In place of capitalism, they push forward a society of economic democracy and Christian corporatism. However, they challenge Syndicalists and social democrats alike by declaring that only an ethnically pure society can be socially and economically just. To them, Lithuania can only be Lithuanian, and a Lithuanian must live and die immersed in national and Catholic culture. While the Naujoji Romuva nominally believe in democracy, they also express that 'temporary' strong hand leadership is necessary and even mandatory to achieve all of their radical reforms.\n\nThe Young Catholic movement sits with the Lithuanian Activist Front, occupying a left-wing, Christian national distributist niche."

In his eyes, the first National Revival was a failure, as it failed to form a truly free Lithuanian state, so the Vairas should be the flag-bearers of a second one, one which will last forever. It disdains Christianity, believing it to be a foreign influence imposed upon Lithuanians, and instead looks towards pagan traditions, which, in Alantas's eyes, are the truest expression of Lithuanian national identity - it idealises a dream where the Lithuanian nation is subservient to a truly nationalist society under a single unquestioned leader, the Vadas, whose citizens are willing to give their life for the Nation, which worships traditions of time immemorial instead of 'the psychosis of democracy'.

La fin du roman laisse entrevoir une possible percée russe, ainsi qu'une invasion navale par l'Empire britannique encore existant...\n\nLe livre a été critiqué pour ses descriptions horribles de cruauté et de crimes de guerre, mais Šeinius défend son récit en disant que "quelque chose comme cela aurait pu arriver dans un autre univers."
