### Ideas ###
SQI_dogmeat_general:0 "Le général de la viande de chien"
SQI_dogmeat_general_desc:0 "Surnommé en raison de son infamie, Zhang Zongchang est décrié même par ses compagnons de guerre en raison de son mépris total pour les conventions et la morale. Ces mêmes traits lui ont cependant valu une réputation redoutable qui attire une certaine classe d'adeptes. Zhang admet ouvertement avoir "trois inconnues" : un nombre inconnu d'épouses, une richesse inconnue et surtout un nombre inconnu de soldats. Ajoutées à son comportement, ces inconnues rendent Zongchang imprévisible, ses véritables objectifs et son potentiel difficiles à déterminer".
SQI_honored_master:0 "Le maître honoré"
SQI_honored_master_desc:0 "Ayant converti l'infâme Zhang Zongchang du sommet du Mont Tai, Zhang Tianran attire l'attention du monde sur lui et éloigne la corruption de Jinan en bas. Publiquement bienveillante mais secrète, l'influence de Zhang Tianran s'accroît et s'étend bien au-delà de ses forteresses monastiques".
SQI_flight_north:0 "Fuite vers le Nord"
SQI_flight_north_desc:0 "Des milliers de personnes fuient vers le Shandong pour échapper au désordre du sud. Poussé par les taxes des seigneurs de la guerre et tiré par les promesses salutaires de Yiguandao, le régime assoupli de Zongchang offre au moins un asile temporaire. Celui qui gouvernera décidera du sort de ces réfugiés".
SQI_Rampant_drug_trade:0 "Rampant Drug Trade"
SQI_Rampant_drug_trade_desc:0 "La propre faiblesse de Zhang Zongchang pour l'opium s'est étendue à la population du Shandong, au grand désarroi de celle-ci. Alors que le prix de la drogue augmente, la violence et l'extorsion s'accélèrent. Les Yiguandao et les Ren Ci tentent de lutter contre le trafic de drogue".
SQI_Yiguandao_revolt:0 "La révolte des Yiguandao"
SQI_Yiguandao_revolt_desc:0 "Les protocoles donnés au Yiguandao en cas de chute de Tianran dans sa mission sacrée ont été déployés par les empereurs mineurs restants et les cadres de deuxième niveau. Les Yiguandao demandent actuellement à leurs disciples de brûler leurs possessions et de se reloger dans des grottes en désespoir de cause pour le délirant Maha-Kalpa, l'apocalypse. Nous ne pouvons pas recruter ou taxer les gens dans cet état frénétique".
SQI_Peasant_revolt:0 "Révolte des paysans"
SQI_Peasant_revolt_desc:0 "L'indignation suscitée par les transactions de Jinan et de Taishan a déstabilisé la province. Les percepteurs d'impôts exigent un paiement immédiat, des routes à péage sont construites par les municipalités et la thésaurisation des armes contre le gouvernement n'a jamais été aussi forte. Nous devons déployer des hommes à la campagne si nous voulons que les habitants du Shandong nous fassent à nouveau confiance".
SQI_Zongchang_revolt:0 "Révolte de Zongchang"
SQI_Zongchang_revolt_desc:0 "Peu importe à quel point Zongchang était avili, sa collection d'administrateurs, de débiteurs et de soldats loyaux a été acceptée à Shandong comme le gouvernement légitime. Aujourd'hui, ses hommes tentent sans but de récupérer les sommes dues par tous ceux qu'ils rencontrent. Ces bandits doivent être mis à bas avec les démons qui les dirigent".
SQI_flee_to_zongchang:0 "Fuite vers Zongchang"
SQI_flee_to_zongchang_desc:0 "L'inhibition finale du commerce avec les puissances occidentales à Shandong, Zhang Tianran, est maintenant vaincue. Les immigrants qui arrivent à Shandong ont maintenant la possibilité de poursuivre le commerce avec les puissances occidentales, ainsi que de s'offrir des conforts plus modernes sans la menace de représailles morales que tant de gens craignaient auparavant. L'atmosphère de Jinan se rapproche lentement du chic des villes chinoises modernes comme Shanghai".
SQI_flight_to_safety:0 "Vol vers Zheyuan"
SQI_flight_to_safety_desc:0 "Après des années de banditisme déguisé en gouvernance, et de tromperie par des manipulateurs religieux, le Shandong est enfin libre. Les habitants du Shandong se réjouiront et prospéreront lorsque la drogue sera enfin brûlée dans un grand feu de joie.  "
SQI_Citoyens loyaux:0 "Citoyens loyaux
SQI_Loyal_citizens_desc:0 "Enfin les retombées des émeutes sont terminées, et le peuple du Shandong se réjouira d'un zèle renouvelé pour changer la Chine dans son ensemble. En conséquence, les collecteurs d'impôts ont pu offrir des crédits d'impôts et des remboursements aux citoyens loyaux".
SQI_controlled_drug_trade:0 "Contrôle du commerce de la drogue"
SQI_controlled_drug_trade_desc:0 "Les plantations d'opium non réglementées ont enfin été subordonnées sous le gouvernement de Zongchang. Le commerce illégal avec Qingdao et Weihaiwei a finalement été officialisé et taxé par la clique de Zongchang. La légalité informelle de la consommation de drogue est maintenant finalisée"
SQI_violently_supressed_drug_trade:0 "Commerce de la drogue violemment réprimé"
SQI_violently_supressed_drug_trade_desc:0 "Tianran a ordonné à l'Organisation caritative et morale de déraciner violemment les toxicomanes présumés et de les soumettre à un jugement. Avec l'aide de la Big Swords Society, le commerce de la drogue a été violemment arrêté, les plantations d'opium brûlées et les bureaucrates corrompus violemment éliminés".
SQI_Japanese_military_assistance:0 "Japanese Officer Training" (Formation des officiers japonais)
SQI_Japanese_military_assistance_desc:0 "Le corps des officiers japonais, invité par Date Junnosuke, a eu un fort impact sur nos formations militaires. Certaines divisions doivent maintenant apprendre les commandements en japonais, et les brochures de la Société du dragon noir sont maintenant couramment utilisées pour motiver les soldats".
SQI_German_military_assistance:0 "German Officer Training" (Formation des officiers allemands)
SQI_German_military_assistance_desc:0 "Les conseillers de la GEA ont eu un fort impact sur le corps des officiers à Shandong. En plus du forage militaire standard de style prussien, les conseillers de l'entreprise ont donné des leçons sur l'achat et la préservation de la valeur des équipements militaires pour la revente après la victoire sur la Chine".
SQI_Legation_military_assistance:0 "Legation Officer Training" (Formation des officiers de la légation)
SQI_Legation_military_assistance_desc:0 "Les conseillers mercenaires américains, britanniques et français engagés par les villes de la Légation se sont mis à la tâche avec brio. Les officiers connaissent maintenant une variété de nouvelles insultes dans de nouvelles langues et ont contracté plusieurs nouvelles maladies vénériennes non découvertes. Dans l'ensemble, un gain positif".
SQI_red_spears:0 "Assistance aux lances rouges"
SQI_red_spears_desc:0 "Les Red Spears du centre du Shandong ont pleinement approuvé le Yiguandao, et sont déterminés à se battre à nos côtés. Leurs dirigeants croient en la nature spirituelle de la lutte pour la Chine contre les démons étrangers".
SQI_big_swords:0 "Big Swords Assistance"
SQI_big_swords_desc:0 "Les Big Swords du nord de la Chine ont enfin pleinement approuvé le Yiguandao, et sont déterminés à se battre à nos côtés. Leurs dirigeants croient en la nature spirituelle de la lutte pour la Chine contre les démons étrangers".
SQI_Guiyidao_support:0 "Guiyidao Support"
SQI_Guiyidao_support_desc:0 "L'imitation de l'Organisation chinoise de moralité et de charité de Tianran a finalement pris le pas sur son inspiration, le Guiyidao. Dans l'intérêt du peuple chinois, Zhang Tianran a pris le contrôle des installations de la Société Rouge de la Swastika à Shandong, et a promis de protéger les temples de Guiyidao contre le banditisme omniprésent.
SQI_intervention_idea:0 "Intervention limitée"
SQI_intervention_idea_desc:0 "À l'instigation des réfugiés de la Ligue, Song Zheyuan a permis un engagement limité dans la vallée chaotique du fleuve jaune et au-delà. Ces courageux corps expéditionnaires sont composés de volontaires dont la préoccupation est la sécurité de leurs familles dans le sud"
SQI_railroad_assisted_army:0 "Railroad Assisted Army"
SQI_railroad_assisted_army_desc:0 "Grâce à une chaîne d'approvisionnement ferroviaire considérablement améliorée, il est désormais possible d'approvisionner les troupes du Shandong de manière beaucoup plus efficace qu'auparavant."

shandong.1.d:0 "The province of Shandong has been carved up of its most valuable land by the Legation States and Germany. The port of Qingdao, once devastated by war between Japan and Germany, now serves as an important port for both the Imperial German Navy and for civilian trade by the Algostasien GmbH. This situation has made Jinan the perfect home for the real power in Shandong. Zhang Zongchang. Zhang came to Shandong in 1911, ostensibly to lead the Shandong Revolutionary Army, but quickly made gambling and whoring his main activity. Jinan has grown like the Dogmeat General has; filthy, profitable, and less defended than initially planned. Atop Tai Shan’s 6,600 steps are the headquarters of the Yiguandao. The mysterious and apparently holy Zhang Tianran has made it the safest and most morally upright place in Shandong. The citizens of Shandong by 1936 have been cornered between disconnected, poverty stricken roads between Jinan and Weihaiwei. Salvation lies in the nearby Jinan or atop Mount Tai."

shandong.2.t:0 "Lu Zhongjie Arrives to Jinan"
shandong.2.d:0 "This day brings to Zongchang another opportunity to humiliate the old man on the mountain, Zhang Tianran. In order to establish his little cult on the hill, Tianran had to expel the sister of his former master, Lu Zhongyi. The sister, Lu Zhongjie, has become a rather concise rebuttal to the numerous Yiguandao well-wishers Zongchang has had to deal with in recent months. This is why she must return to Shandong, if only as a joke. To enhance the shock value, Zongchang has brought his old mother to this welcoming ceremony, which has swelled from the intended group into a sizable crowd. Zongchang, in an attempt to enhance the humiliation Tianran should feel, has given the elderly Lu Zhongjie a bouquet and a traditional twenty-one gun salute was fired into a nearby apartment building in celebration of Lu Zhongjie's arrival."
shandong.2.a:0 "Bullets have to go somewhere"

shandong.970.t:0 "Zongchang's festivities escelate through Jinan"
shandong.970.d:0 "After that rouse of fun and violence, Zongchang dropped his mother off with Lu Zhongjie and has decided to celebrate a night on the town. Zongchang stops ocassionally to distribute 'Minsheng' to refugees from Jiangsu. Another encounter that day were Yiguandao protesters at Zongchang's business office. Their daily empty promises have been replaced by outrage over Lu Zhongjie's return to Shandong. Before Zongchang attempted to hit them with his car, they claimed that Tianran would arrive to judge Zongchang's very soul. The only thing that soured the evening was finding out that Zongchang's opium dealer is still in hiding. This no doubt is caused by interloping Ren Ci who have foiled otherwise fun evenings in Jinan with their morality in the past. The adventure ended with a visit to Zongchang's favorite brothel, where several women joined his entourage on the way home that evening to do drugs. As the day comes to an end, one of these ladies has gone missing with some opium, Zongchang asks his officers not to go after her, for there is still plenty more ladies and capsules of opium for the night."
shandong.970.a:0 "Her loss then"

shandong.3.t:0 "A spy for Zheyuan is captured"
shandong.3.d:0 "After a night of hard drugs and soft women in Jinan, Zongchang was reveling in himself the next morning when he saw a stranger in his backyard. Alerting his wives, and then his guards, Zongchang apprehended the intruder. After Sun Dianying's own special words with the man, it was revealed that he was an ally of Song Zheyuan, and had come after a sex worker had alerted him to drugs on the property. Dianying believes that this intruder is the vanguard of a rebellion Zheyuan is planning out of Qufu. A fear Dianying has stoked for several months since his income from taxation was cut off by Zheyuan's militia. Commander Date Junnosuke, on the other hand, insists to the hungover Zongchang that Zheyuan is planning to alert the Qing instead. Date insists that their forces be diverted to Dezhou to stop Zheyuan from escaping. Barely able to recall the night before, Zongchang decides to..."
shandong.3.a:0 "Block the roads, Zheyuan must be leaving"
shandong.3.b:0 "Send men to Zheyuan's house"

shandong.971.t:0 "Date Junnosuke attacks Zheyuan at Dezhou"
shandong.971.d:0 "Date Junnosuke's forces arrived at Dezhou to strong public distaste, stronger revulsion than usual. It was immediately apparent that the town has been turned over to the Ren Ci and Zheyuan. Date sent his cavalry into Dezhou to search out Zheyuan, with the looming and dangerous prospect of a possible raid into the Qing kingdom. Zheyuan was found near the Haido Jinshan temple, paying respects to his ancestors. Date's soldiers seized Zheyuan, and a skirmish began between his Ren Ci militiamen and the cavalry. Fortunately Date brought enough firepower to eliminate the militia and Zheyuan in the process. Unfortunately, the abundance of witnesses in Dezhou required a lot more fighting to silence. At the end of the battle, the Haido Jinshan temple was in flames, and Date was retreating back towards Jinan trying his best to think up an alibi."
shandong.971.a:0 "That was a Boxer temple, nobody will care"

shandong.972.t:0 "Sun Dianying fails to find Zheyuan at Qufu"
shandong.972.d:0 "The soldiers sent to Qufu found what they wanted, but not what they needed. After threats of violence were given by Dianying, and several quarters burned, the occupants of Qufu fled as Dianying began searching for Zheyuan. While there was abundant evidence that the Ren Ci had used the manor, neither Zheyuan nor the Duke Yansheng were to be found. Zongchang waited several days for a response from Dianying, and received Dianying's most humble apologies and gifts from Confcuian manor. These gifts did little to sate Zongchang's anger, who immediately set out with the Japanese cavalry to Dezhou, furious that Date's advice was not taken. Zongchang's arrival in Dezhou failed to find Zheyuan, not even evidence of him being there. Faced with the dangerous prospect of sending a raid into the Qing kingdom on the hunch of Date Junnosuke, Zongchang decided the investigation was over, and returned to Jinan to continue his harassment campaign on the Yiguandao."
shandong.972.a:0 "At least I got some gifts out of this"

shandong.4.t:0 "Zongchang sends an alibi to the Qing"
shandong.4.d:0 "Several books of poetry, and a commentary on the classics has proven to be very helpful to Zongchang at this moment. Letters that used to contain embarassing misspellings and poor stroke order are now refined in a golden alibi Zongchang has sent to the Qing government. This alibi intends to answer what caused such a panic in Dezhou recently, and why this issue should not bother Puyi or Wu Peifu in the least. The letter paints the picture of a province filled with bandits and conmen. This enviroment, explains the letter, leads to unfounded rumors of moral decay in Shandong, which is certainly exaggerations by conmen like Zhang Tianran. Furthermore, the letter adds that Zongchang had found and eliminated a cell of KMT holdouts in Shandong, and there is no reason to be concerned about traitors to the emperor, no matter what they may claim."
shandong.4.a:0 "Nothing to see here, move along"

shandong.5.t:0 "Qing Magistrates Arrest Zongchang"
shandong.5.d:0 "Sun Dianying was a fool. While he was burining and looting Zheyuan's manor, the man himself was already halfway to Beiping. Despite Dianying's excuses and efforts to uncover the plotters in Shandong, it left Jinan vunerable to a large contigent of Qing infantry that entered Jinan. Even worse, Zongchang had no way of knowing the Qing soliders were there to arrest him. A written letter by Zongchang from prison to the Emperor asking him to allow family visitation has been rejected. Zongchang now has a forth Unknown, unknown when he will be released from prison for his numerous crimes. The other day, one of the many children of Zongchang approached Song Zhyuan, asking him if his father will survive his imprisonment."
shandong.5.a:0 "Your daddy will be fine in prison"

shandong.6.t:0 "Mount Tai Outraged at Zongchang"
shandong.6.d:0 "It did not take long for the teacher Tianran to find out about Lu Zhongjie. The intial reaction being delivered in a request to return to Mount Tai for more treatment of his long-gone illness. These letters were ignored by Zongchang, wishing to further annoy the teacher on the mountain and to humiliate him by publicly reading the letters. Finally the last letter delivered today took on a much darker tone. The letter adressed the people of Jinan, and accused Zongchang of smuggling opium into China, betraying Chinese for Western gambling partners, and of trying to take Lu Zhongjie as a wife. Tianran has challenged Zongchang to come to Mount Tai to receive his eternal judgement, or else the people of Shandong will wither and die to punish their leader. Sun Dianying recommends contronting and purifying Mount Tai of its residents, while another commander, Zhang Jingyao, recommends waiting the teacher out."

shandong.7.t:0 "Tianran Passes Judgement on Zongchang"
shandong.7.d:0 "Zongchang's contigent arrived at the gates of the Dai Miao, already his soles tired of the 6600 steps. Dianying suggested they conceal their guns, and open fire when they are let in. As Zongchang passed under the Zhengyang Gate, he was fatally shot by a sharpshooter from atop the gate. Dianying attempted to charge the courtyard with whatever men he had, but Jingyao had fled with the soldiers guarding his rear. Dianying was also fatally shot, and the current wherebouts of Zhang Jingyao is unknown. The honored teacher Zhang Tianran was received in Jinan with an early New Years celebration, and read his final letter to Zongchang to a cheering croud."
shandong.7.a:0 "I declare this a Red Letter Day!"

shandong.8.t:0 "Zongchang Saves Jinan from Yiguandao Raid"
shandong.8.d:0 "The following weeks in Jinan have shown how far Tianran's influince had come. Members of the public have defaced Zongchang's office, and several former freinds have written to Zongchang asking him to prostrate himself before the Yiguandao. In return, Zongchang has told his commanders to man the walls of Jinan, extort and search all suspected Yiguandao members they come across, and deliver anything suspicious to him. Several of the items confiscated included poison labeled as medicine, small arms, and curses against Zongchang. Today Zongchang was delivering another reading of Tianran's letter, along with a dissertation into the evils of the Yiguandao, when a mob of them entered the city. Zongchang's soldiers quickly engaged the cultists that were carrying guns, and Japanese cavalry chased the rest out. Tianran, while attempting to hide his shining head, was caught and shot by the cavalry."

When rumor spread that Zongchang had Tianran along with all of the Yiguandao fighters buried dishonorably in a mass grave, panic spread across Shandong. The remaining Yiguandao across Shandong have begun to aggressively attack policemen and landlords throughout the province. Townspeople, fearing both the fanatic and the now-demonized Zongchang clique, have begun to shield themselves from the outside world.

This issue speaks directly to the commanders in Shandong, as they were trained in schools in the north and south. It is well known that the prestige of the school you attend is as important as the training at the school. Therefore we must attempt to send young officers-in-training abroad.

The Army Command has convinced [SQI.GetLeader] to put some resources into projects recently made by a Czech resident of Shandong, Hanchtedelay. Hanchtedelay has ambitions to transform several Studebaker cars that he owns into crude tanks. A second plan is to purchase Flying Pigeon bicycles from Tianjin and train a divison to use them.

[SQI.GetLeader] has been called in to suprvise the investigation before it becomes a major scandal in Jinan. The police, ever cautious of the chinese border guards outside of Qingdao, have suggested we investigate the railway relay stations first.

These constructs appear to be a cushion and luggage straps. There is no doubt that whomever has been stealing from the rail lines has been throwing their hauls off the train, where it is moved to a second location.

Upon inspecting the floor of the shack, however, a large empty alcove was discovered. There being no logical use for such a large empty space below the shack, the police chief has decided to arrest the attending border guards.

Finally, in astonishment, several bandits exited the hold and removed their clothing. These bandits then dropped their weapons, and began to haul the trunks towards our offensive line. In shock, [SQI.GetLeader] ordered his line to hold heir fire, and let these apparently insane bandits pass. Soldiers were in such an uproar of laughter humiliating these bandits, that nobody noticed that another contigent of bandits had slipped through the woods until the whole display was over.

Members of their Red Spears and Big Swords have come to request arms from local magistrates and governors.

Amazingly, his Rec Ci even received pledges from the anti-bandit peasant armies that control south Shandong.

On a sunny day, a woman wearing winter garb from Beijing approached Zhang Tianran. The Yiguandao guards claim she is a matriarch like Tianran's wife, Sun Suzhen, but she stands before him with two pistols on her belt. Zhao Hong Wenguo, mother of Beijing student leader Zhao Dong, is here to offer her families services to the Yiguandao. Zhao Hong Wenguo claims to do this not out of religious loyalty or financial need, but because the Yiguandao appears to her the essential resistance against Japanese agression that threatens her home. The Honored Master agrees, and reiterates his promise to never cooperate with the Japanese in exchange for her families financial and tactical services.

Within the inner circle of the Yiguandao, a debate rages between Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen over how to best engage the literati in Shandong. Tianran and Suzhen have both collaborated on a book entitled 'Provisional Etiquette', intended to demonstrate how the Yiguandao respects the spiritual lineage of chinese leadership. To Zhang Tianran, who was once a minor bureaucrat under Yuan Shikai, the spiritual lineage of China's dictator went from the the Regent Zaifeng to Yuan Shikai, then finally to the enthroned Puyi. To Sun Suzhen however, spiritual lineage in China belonged to Sun Yat-Sen, and through Sun Yat-Sen's death there is no true spiritual leader of China currently. Zhang's interpretation appears to hold to his agreement to promote Puyi as Emperor within the Yiguandao, but ignores the wellspring of spiritual support for the southern idealists."

To Zhang Tianran and the Yiguandao, the history of the world is divided into three periods by three periods of peace and barbarism, represented by Three Suns. The last aeon, that of the Red Sun, ended with the Xinhai Revolution. The Confucian legend Kang Yuowei is refenced in Zhang Tianran's speech, which agreed that the third age, Datong, or Maha-Kalpa was dawning. Soon, claims Tianran, the Chinese people will be perfected racially or be destroyed by foreigners like the Japanese Emperor or the British Empire.\n\nTo the uncertain people of Shandong, the only concrete suggestion out of so much esoteric ado is that they should work harder towards national unification, and reinforces the already-prevelant feeling of existential struggle they feel."

After following a tip that the Teacher Juzan spoke to Lu Zhongjie when he published his defamation againt us, the Red Spears snuck into Hunan. One of our most loyal minor Emperors has managed to hunt her down and bring her back to us, after all these years. Within the inner circle, a debate rages over how to handle this windfall. To Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen, keeping Lu Zhongjie alive is tempting further dissenters to venerate her as the reincarnated Guan Yin.

This comes several years after his failed Commentaries on the Thirteen Classics. To many readers, the only moral advice the commentary provided was anecdotal lessons on how Confucius approved of polygamy. While the poems might be questionable, the Dogmeat General seems to be quite pleased with himself, cutting down his daily degeneracy."

shandong.426.t:0 "The Dogmeat General's Second Publication"
shandong.426.d:0 "Zhang Zongchang has released his second Commentary on the Thirteen classics, and horribly insults Wu Peifu's writings! Describing Wu Peifu's writings as circumstatial, and in line with the Beijing style of conforming to political interests over absolute morality. The Dogmeat General writes in the Commentary that the works of Mencius tracks well with the current crisis in China, and draws a favorable comparison between the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, and the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang."
shandong.426.a:0 "Thankfully Xueliang's father can't read it"

shandong.427.t:0 "Sun Dogs or Rain Dogs"
shandong.427.d:0 "Zongchang, reaching new depths of depravity, has decided to take the wife of his commander, Sun Dianying. Enraged, General Sun has decided to blackmail Zhongchang into promoting him. The Dogmeat General is obviously known for his lust and degeneracy, but even this would alienate his officers. While he wants to keep this quiet, should he concede it might weaken his standing and position."

shandong.428.t:0 "Old King Coal and the Dogmeat General"
shandong.428.d:0 "A debacle during the early 1930s has come back to haunt Zhang Zongchang's administration. In those years Zongchang imposed a 40 cent tax on exported coal as a means to profit off of coal operations from Qingdao. this tax, however, was so exorbently high that no mining company has ever paid it. Yet still there is mining in Eastern Shandong. A more radical solution has been concocted, which has Zhang Zongchang fund a coal miner syndicate to empower coal miners to fight their bosses. This gamble carries with it a level of agreement with KMT cells in Eastern Shandong to let them excite workers towards syndication. This kind of ideological manipulation, to Zongchang’s staff, feels as if pulled from Yan Xishan's playbook."
shandong.428.a:0 "A shade of Yan Xishan Thought, I see?"

shandong.429.t:0 "Brothel Brawl for Business"
shandong.429.d:0 "Zhongchang, whether due to being drug addled, or for his own amusement, appointed two men to the same position as Chief of Security. The two men only found out about the other when they both at the same time went to take their new position. Seeking clarification on the issue, they barged into Zhongchang's room, where they found him engaged in depravity as usual. Zhongchang, amused at their confusion, ordered the two men to fight each other for the position, and whoever was on top would claim victory, though he did not rule out a power bottom. The men thus proceeded to tear into each other, much to Zhongchang's and the girls amusement."
shandong.429.a:0 "It seems it was an orgy in more ways than one"

shandong.430.t:0 "The Cheapest Medicine"
shandong.430.d:0 "The threat of famine has returned to Shandong due to the proliferation of the Opium trade in the province. Due to how much land is currently used for Opium production, people are beginning to tighten their belts. In previous years, petitions to the central government would be made to relive the people. To Zhang Zongchang, this option carries with it too much risk of another warlord discovering his opium plantations. As a result, the Dogmeat General has taken a fatalistic position, and commanded that his soldiers only provide to those whom they feel worthy of food aid."
shandong.430.a:0 "The hardest choices require the strongest of wills"

shandong.431.t:0 "Sun Dianying Builds Bandit Temples"
shandong.431.d:0 "General Sun Dianying's autonomy within the military is great, so much so that his officers act as if Sun Dianying is a clique within the clique. Sun Dianying's soldiers, having looted Taishan of it's Yiguandao books, have concieved of a plan to entrench Sun Dianying's power. As Sun Dianying was a leader once of the Temple Road Society in Henan before retreating to Shandong, his men have thought it prudent to recreate the society on Taishan. Atop Taishan, under a mandatory opium haze, Sun Dianying hasbuilt a shrine called The Ninth Heaven. Sun Dianying's soldiers have reportedly begun painting Te and Sheng characters on their faces."
shandong.431.a:0 "Hard to escape faith in Shandong"

shandong.432.t:0 "The Empress Has No Clothes"
shandong.432.d:0 "Sun Dianying has led a group to rob the grave of Empress Dowager Cixi in Beijing, a shocking development. While her legacy has been debated between being a ruthless despot who brought about great humiliation, some still consider her to be a paragon of Chinese society. Looting her grave is a deep insult regardless, and the Qing are deeply embarrased."
shandong.432.a:0 "That belongs in a museum!"

shandong.433.t:0 "The Ming Demeaned Once More"
shandong.433.d:0 "Sun Dianying, in his lust for gold and booty, has decided to rob the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum grave in Nanjing. The Ming Xiaoling Tomb belonging to he Hongwu Emperor the first Ming. Hongwu who was a Red Turban in a White Lotus Society like the hated Zhang Tianran, fueling Sun Dianying's fury. The grave has been looted and set ablaze, not since Li Zicheng did so in 1644 when he took Beijing has this happened. It really does seem that there is no honour to restore the Ming, despite what those old slogans have said. The hundreds who, in the past, promised to 'Destroy the Qing, Restore the Ming', are silent to the desecration."
shandong.433.a:0 "Is nothing sacred anymore?"

shandong.434.t:0 "A New Headquarters?"
shandong.434.d:0 "Our expansion has led us to occupy more and greater territory than just Shandong province. While some hardliners wish us to remain in Jinan, as it has served as our capital all this time, others have suggested we move to Nanjing, where there is more rail and communication lines thus making it easier to project power over our new acquisitions."

shandong.436.d:0 "After being given the traditional medicine, the Honored Teacher Zhang Tianran has retired to a Grotto-heaven to end his mortal life. The Honored Teacher has left us with no heirs, as is the way of the Yiguandao, and his personal effects donated to the needy from Mount Tai. The Moon to Zhang's sun, Sun Suzhen, has taken his role as 18th Matriarch and first unwedded Honored Teacher of the Yiguandao.

Au lieu de mourir, Puyi fut forcé de capituler devant Zhang Tianran dans sa veste jaune impériale, ainsi que de réaffirmer au peuple son empereur. Puyi restera l'empereur, et les petits empereurs, directeurs et prêtres du Shangqing Tianguo les magistrats officiels de l'Empire des Qing. Zhang Tianran a absous l'empereur captif de toute culpabilité dans cette guerre, et a déclaré que cette victoire est l'aboutissement d'une généalogie spirituelle qui a commencé avec les Boxeurs et Sun Yat Sen."

Après ne pas être arrivés pour les exercices quotidiens, les soldats de la Lance Rouge ont découvert que Xue Dian avait disparu de ses quartiers. La panique s'est installée alors que les Red Spears se sont précipités en vain pour retrouver Xue Dian. Cette panique s'est amplifiée lorsque le vieux professeur de Homored, Lu Zhongjie, n'a pas pu être retrouvé lui aussi. Après que Zhang Tianran soit arrivé dans une fureur peu commune, il s'est retiré dans la maison de Xue Dian pour demander conseil aux esprits. Après plusieurs heures, Zhang Tianran sortit des quartiers de Xue Dian et déclara que l'empereur mineur avait été appelé par une puissance supérieure à s'engager dans un pèlerinage immédiat et permanent. Alors que les soldats de la Lance Rouge sont rassasiés, les dissidents à l'extérieur de Taishan ont facilement déduit que Xue Dian et Lu Zhongjie ont échappé au culte. À la surprise de beaucoup, dont Sun Suzhen, Zhang Tianran n'a pas ordonné de chasse à l'homme. Il semble que le Maître honoré ait accepté une conséquence qu'il n'avait pas prévue."
