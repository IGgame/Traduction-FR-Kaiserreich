NEE_entente_allies_desc:0 "Our ties to Canada means we are a member of the Entente - whether we like it or not.

If they intend to fight us on this decision, then we must be prepared to meet them in battle."

#Reclaiming America
NEE_reclaiming_america:0 " Réclamer les États-Unis d'Amérique"
NEE_reclaiming_america_desc:0 "La Cloche de la Liberté sonne toujours à Boston alors même que d'autres parties de notre belle nation se sont déchirées. Depuis l'intervention canadienne qui a créé notre gouvernement provisoire, nous avons espéré que la démocratie l'emporterait dans la guerre civile. Si ce n'est pas le cas, nous devons nous armer de courage pour porter le flambeau de la liberté, dernier vestige de l'Amérique démocratique".

NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Nos pires craintes sont apparues alors que la guerre civile américaine déchire la nation, des côtes du Pacifique aux champs pétrolifères du Texas, en passant par les usines de fumage des Grands Lacs. Nous n'avons réussi à échapper à la terreur que par la grâce de l'Empire britannique, mais même notre avenir semble troublé car ce n'est qu'une question de temps avant que les blocs du Sud qui s'affrontent idéologiquement ne regardent vers le Nord, prêts à reprendre ce qu'ils considèrent comme leur terre légitime. C'est pour eux que nous devons être préparés et que des systèmes de défense doivent être créés, du fleuve Hudson aux rues de Boston. Nous pouvons paraître faibles sur le papier, mais il faudra jusqu'à la dernière goutte de vrai sang américain pour nous abattre."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Déployer le système de défense antiaérienne"
NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "La guerre moderne a montré la valeur d'une force aérienne et les destructions massives qu'elle peut causer sur les armées d'autrefois. Alors que nous essayons désespérément de rester dans la course aérienne, nos installations industrielles sont bien plus petites que celles de nos ennemis, ce qui a incité le Haut Commandement à se concentrer plutôt sur la création d'un système élaboré de défense antiaérienne capable d'annuler la supériorité aérienne de nos adversaires".

NEE_hudson_line:0 "Fortifiez la ligne d'Hudson"
NEE_hudson_line_desc:0 "S'écoulant vers la grande ville de New York, le fleuve Hudson est d'une grande valeur pour tout défenseur. Placer des §YBunkers§ ! sur ses rives peut s'avérer très utile pour arrêter la menace du Sud".

NEE_connecticut_line:0 "Repli vers le fleuve Connecticut"
NEE_connecticut_line_desc:0 "Bien que notre principale ligne de défense se trouve sur le fleuve Hudson, il faut toujours se préparer à l'imprévu et, à ce titre, nous devrions envisager de créer une ligne de force égale derrière le fleuve Connecticut.

NEE_boston_last_stand_desc:0 "Les rivières ont été percées et les troupes ennemies inondent la campagne de la Nouvelle-Angleterre. Boston est toujours debout, mais l'évacuation générale de sa population civile a déjà été décrétée. \"Il peut sembler que la guerre se retourne contre nous, mais les hommes et les femmes de Boston n'entreront pas doucement dans la nuit.

#Sway Public Opinion
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion:0 "Établir la légitimité"
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "Nous sommes un gouvernement qui a été mis en place par une puissance étrangère - et donc beaucoup sont désireux de ne pas tenir compte de notre droit à l'existence, ou de nous traiter de traîtres pour ne pas avoir pesé sur la guerre civile qui fait rage dans le reste de la nation. Nous devons combattre l'opinion selon laquelle nous servons les intérêts britanniques plutôt que les citoyens américains, et cela implique un changement d'attitude chez nous. Ne pas le faire signifie la dissolution éventuelle de notre gouvernement une fois la guerre civile terminée - ou pire.\n\n Légitimité actuelle :  §G[?NEE.NEE_legitimacy]§!"

NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour:0 "Organisez une tournée présidentielle de bonne volonté"
NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Même si notre ministère de la propagande travaille 24 heures sur 24, l'homme de la rue n'est pas convaincu que le pouvoir réel s'exerce à Boston et voit le \"président\" comme une simple marionnette de chaussettes canadiennes qui suit avec bonheur tous les ordres d'Ottawa. En faisant le tour du président et du cabinet élu en Nouvelle-Angleterre, nous espérons convaincre les gens que leur vrai président et chef est bien [NEE.GetLeader]".

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motiver la presse étrangère"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Les journalistes de tous les coins du monde ont cette fâcheuse habitude de rapporter les nouvelles de notre pays comme s'il s'agissait de l'État de la \"Nouvelle-Angleterre\", les journaux socialistes allant même jusqu'à nous appeler la province canadienne de la Nouvelle-Angleterre. Cela ne suffira plus, car nous ne nous laisserons pas berner et ils reconnaîtront bientôt que la seule véritable nation américaine est la nôtre. Mais pour l'instant, nous devrons nous contenter de glisser un peu d'argent vers les plus grands fauteurs de troubles et de leur demander poliment de nous appeler les États-Unis d'Amérique".

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Augmenter la représentation étrangère dans la R&D"
NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "La guerre fait peut-être rage plus que jamais, mais les scientifiques américains travaillent toujours dans les laboratoires et les installations d'ingénierie des universités de l'Ivy League. Précisons que [Root.GetNameDef] a les moyens d'innover et de se placer à part parmi les leaders mondiaux".

NEE_labour_relation_act:0 "Adopter la loi sur les relations de travail"

NEE_Dropping_Propaganda_desc:0 "L'avion a non seulement révolutionné notre façon de voyager, de transporter des marchandises ou même de faire la guerre, mais aussi la façon dont nous pouvons diffuser nos messages. Grâce à l'utilisation de ballons, de bombardiers et même d'un simple avion de combat, l'initiative \"Freedom Fliers\" a été chargée de survoler le territoire ennemi pour mener une guerre non pas physique mais psychologique, dans l'espoir de perturber l'esprit de ceux qui ne sont peut-être pas totalement à bord avec la nation pour laquelle ils se battent."

NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda:0 "Choisir notre message"
NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda_desc:0 "Même s'il y a un accord pour que les Freedom Fliers partent vers les cieux, le conflit règne toujours au sein du ministère de la propagande car la recherche du message "parfait" ne connaît pas de fin et les concepteurs sont renvoyés à la planche à dessin."

Presque abandonnés par leur gouvernement, nous prévoyons que nos cousins de la Nouvelle-Angleterre accueilleront favorablement notre intervention".

Certains membres du gouvernement ont toutefois suggéré qu'il serait préférable que nous occupions et administrions simplement le territoire nous-mêmes.

newengland.14.t:0 "Le Canada refuse"
newengland.14.d:0 "Peut-être que le gouvernement canadien a décidé que nous sommes un atout trop précieux dans sa quête pour reprendre les Home Isles, ou peut-être qu'il convoite secrètement le territoire de la Nouvelle-Angleterre comme étant le sien, le gouvernement canadien a refusé d'accorder à la Nouvelle-Angleterre l'autonomie gouvernementale.

By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."

newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."

newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."

Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."

newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

#TEX
newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the deep South all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."
newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the master of horror."

newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
newengland.60.a:0 "He just need a few days off."

newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry. Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisers about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases."

newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove fire traced back to Tobin"
newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city."

newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center artifacts recovered, some defaced"
newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians apply for West Point"
newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people."

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information."
newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences."
newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front."
newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demoralise their troops."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"
newengland.72.b:0 "It's too risky."

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing."
newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government."

newengland.81.t:0 "Riots in New England"
newengland.81.d:0 "The agitation of the so-called 'Yankee Rebellion' continues, with riots having broken out in several major cities across the region. Canadian forces have put down these disturbances with relatively small loss of life and property, but report that things are likely to get worse before they get better."
newengland.81.a:0 "Americans!"

newengland.82.t:0 "The Yankee Resistance"
newengland.82.d:0 "The rebellion in New England continues, this time with a group referring to itself as the 'Yankee Resistance' setting off explosives in several major areas. The resulting damage and panic has made for a headache, and calls for Canada to end its occupation have redoubled in force."
newengland.82.a:0 "Would they prefer to be in a civil war?!"

newengland.83.t:0 "Canadian Troops Attacked"
newengland.83.d:0 "Several military installations within the New England area have been attacked by the 'Yankee Resistance' - not enough to cause real damage, but enough to draw the notice of the newspapers and the public, keeping the occupation in the public eye far longer than we'd like."
newengland.83.a:0 "How annoying."

newengland.84.t:0 "Major Attack in [attack.GetName]"
newengland.84.d:0 "A major attack in [attack.GetName] by Yankee Resistance forces has left several hundred injured and a public debacle which has put the New England occupation in the Canadian news spotlight once again. The disruption in [attack.GetName] has been considerable, and [attack.GetName] newspapers are filled with headlines about how New Englanders should have fought in the civil war - going so far as to call siding with the Canadians a form of cowardice. There is pushback from many sides, but the rebellion continues to be a headache for Canadian occupation forces."
newengland.84.a:0 "Hopefully this will end at some point."

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

newengland.90.t:0 "Rejoining America"
newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America."
newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests."

newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well."
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that."

newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request."
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand."

newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.95.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against radical forces, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go."
newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse."

newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
newengland.97.a:0 "So be it!"
newengland.97.b:0 "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
newengland.97.c:0 "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

newengland.98.t:0 "New England Dissolves"
newengland.98.d:0 "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy. The region is once again under our control, and very possibly may lead us into a war with [requester.GetNameDef]."
newengland.98.a:0 "So be it!"

newengland.99.t:0 "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.99.d.exists:0 "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere. Many within our government are enraged, and wonder if New England's citizens feel the same as its government... or, perhaps it is better to say, the British?"
newengland.99.d.notexists:0 "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown. With their refusal to allow New England to choose its own destiny, the New England government has collapsed and been re-absorbed into [CAN.GetNameDef]."
newengland.99.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.99.b:0 "We'll deal with this later."

newengland.100.t:0 "New England's Betrayal"
newengland.100.d:0 "While our government had refused New England's right to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], it seems they eventually decided to do so anyhow. Our forces in the region have pulled out as American forces moved in, and there appears to be nothing we can do - unless we choose to force the issue and make this a matter of war."
newengland.100.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.100.b:0 "Let them have it."

###############################################

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."
NEE_MERRITT_A_EDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 25, 1897, in Rutland, Vermont, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Merritt Austin Edson joined the University of Vermont in 1915, and in June 1916 he joined the First Infantry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard, where he was sent to Eagle Pass, Texas to work in the Mexican Border. He'd return to Vermont in September, but some time after returning to his university he signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1913, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."
NEE_GEORGE_KENNEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 6, 1889, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Churchill Kenney entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1907 where he followed a course in civil engineering. He never completed his studies, as his father abandoned his family and he was forced to work in order to sustain his family. He later enlisted as a flying cadet for the Aviation section of the US Signal Corps. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 5th of November of 1917 and would wouldn't be promoted until 1921 after taking a course at the Air Service Engineering School of Dayton, Ohio. He became Air Service Inspector of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1926, Kenney became a student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, where he became increasingly interested in the combined used of the air force and the army to coordinate deadly attacks. In September 1932, Kenney entered the Army War College in Washington D.C. where he joined one of several committees studying Weltkrieg battles, where he became an expert on the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, and began working on what came to be known as the War Plan Orange. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in March 1935, and was assigned to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, in Georgia. However, seeing the buildup to the civil war from the Longist South, Kenney was certain that hostilities were about to break out so he prepared an escape plane with a group of loyalists, and decided to escape northwards as soon as hostilities broke out. Despite all odds, the plane managed to reach New England unscathed, and Kenney has joined the New England General Staff to provide for their defence any way he cans."
NEE_WILLARD_G_WYMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 21, 1898, in Augusta, Maine, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Willard Gordon Wyman entered the United States Military Academy in 1917 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coastal Artillery Branch, and later transferred to the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army. He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return. The lack of capable staff forced an early promotion to Brigadier General for Wyman, but he has shown willingness to learn despite being thrown in such a difficult position."
NEE_LEMUEL_SHEPHERD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 10, 1896, in Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lemuel Cornick 'Lem' Shepherd Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1917, and would enter the Marine Corps right after as a second lieutenant. He'd slowly climbed his way to Captain in 1922, where he was assigned to the Marine Company that assisted the Brazil's Centennial Exposition and would be later reassigned to the Marine Detachment in the USS New York. In 1927, he was shipped to Tianjin to serve in the 3rd Marine Brigade guarding the American Legation in the city. Lemuel would return to America in 1929 and graduate from the Field Officers' Course in 1932. He'd be sent to Haiti to serve with the Garde d'Haïti as a District and Department Commander, where he earned his promotion to Major. In 1934, Shepherd was detailed to the Marine Barracks, Washington, D. C., as Executive Officer and as Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute and would be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1936. After his promotion, he was assigned to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. With the country spiralling into Civil War and the Canadian seizure of New England, Shepherd presented his services to the New England Government, earning his promotion to Brigadier General and being assigned to the New England Marine Corps, where his experience shall be greatly valued by the small New England staff.""
