### Events ###
 serbia.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
 serbia.0.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire, and war-hero Petar Bojovic was appointed Regent.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time the government has become increasingly jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attention southwards; towards Macedonia. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the revanchist Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nMeanwhile, the Serbian throne has remained empty. Austria has threatened to intervene in the event of a Karađorđević restoration, and the Vojvoda has complied, blocking the former Crown Prince Alexander’s attempts at returning and alienating many Royalists in the process. With the regency slowly losing support, can Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"

Bien qu'elles s'attendaient à une campagne facile, les forces autrichiennes n'ont réussi à occuper la Serbie qu'à la fin de 1915, et grâce à l'entrée de la Bulgarie dans la guerre. Après la guerre, les territoires du sud de la Serbie ont été remis à la Bulgarie, tandis que le reste a été maintenu sous occupation autrichienne jusqu'en 1926, date à laquelle les Autrichiens ont été contraints de retirer leurs troupes en raison de tensions ethniques ailleurs dans l'Empire. Depuis, la Serbie a lutté pour survivre, faisant profil bas, sachant qu'elle ne pouvait résister à aucune attaque militaire. Au fil du temps, cependant, le gouvernement est devenu de plus en plus anti-autrichien et jingoïste, et sachant qu'il ne pouvait espérer vaincre l'Autriche, ils ont plutôt tourné leur attention vers le sud, vers les terres occupées par la Bulgarie. Plusieurs pourparlers diplomatiques ont déjà eu lieu avec les gouvernements roumain et grec en vue de saper l'hégémonie bulgare dans la région, et certains disent qu'il n'est pas trop tôt pour parler d'une alliance formelle. \n\nLa Serbie peut-elle obtenir la victoire face à 'la question bulgare' ?

In their polite, but firm statement, [From.GetAdjectiveDef] diplomats cited their inability to trust our intentions behind the organisation, and subsequently do not feel comfortable sharing their state secrets with Belgrade."
 serbia.36.a:0 "Their loss."

 serbia.37.t:0 "End of the Balkan Research Initiative"
 serbia.37.d.war:0 "Today, [From.GetAdjectiveDef] embassy has given us a rather expected telegram. Following our declaration of war on a member of the Balkan Research Initiative, [From.GetNameDef] has taken the executive decision to remove us from the Initiative with immediate effect, while also holding onto the military and industrial plans that we had shared with them in the past. In essence, we have forfeited our rather privileged position."
 serbia.37.d.joined_other_faction:0 "Today, [From.GetAdjectiveDef] embassy has given us a rather expected telegram. Following our exit from the [From.GetFactionName], [From.GetNameDef] has taken the executive decision to remove us from the Initiative with immediate effect, while also holding onto the military and industrial plans that we had shared with them in the past. In essence, we have forfeited our rather privileged position."
 serbia.37.a:0 "Drat."

 serbia.38.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wishes to Join the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 serbia.38.d:0 "We have received a message from [FROM.GetNameDef], in which they have requested to join the [ROOT.GetFactionName]. In their message, they cited the long-standing bonds between [From.GetAdjectiveDef] and our governments, while also pledging their military and airforce towards any future conflicts the [ROOT.GetFactionName] finds itself in. How should we respond?"
 serbia.38.a:0 "More allies are always welcome."
 serbia.38.b:0 "They're more trouble than they'd be worth."

 serbia.39.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Alliance"
 serbia.39.d.ENT:0 "It appears our attempts to join the [From.GetFactionName] have borne fruit. Today, diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] met with the Prime Minister, formally accepting our request to rejoin our former brothers-in-arms in their future conflicts against the Syndicalists. In the coming days, a formal treaty will be signed between [Root.GetNameDef] and members of the [From.GetFactionName], solidifying our reforged diplomatic bonds."
 serbia.39.d.RUS:0 "It appears our attempts to join the [From.GetFactionName] have borne fruit. Today, diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] met with the Prime Minister, formally accepting our request to rejoin our cultural brothers in their future conflicts against the hegemon of Europe. In the coming days, a formal treaty will be signed between [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef], solidifying our reforged diplomatic bonds."
 serbia.39.a:0 "Allies once again!"

 serbia.40.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Disbands the Belgrade Pact"
 serbia.40.d:0 "Today, we’ve received an urgent message from [From.GetNameDef]. Following recent diplomatic negotiations, [From.GetAdjectiveDef] officials have moved to disband the Belgrade Pact, citing that the situation of Europe has immeasurably changed, and a small regional alliance will be unable to protect the Balkans from external threats any longer. They’ve implored us to follow their lead in seeking protection from larger powers, and have apologised for the situation."
 serbia.40.a:0 "Oh well."

 serbia.41.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Alliance"
 serbia.41.d:0 "It appears our attempts to join the [From.GetFactionName] have failed. Today, diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] gave a formal response to the Prime Minister, rejecting our attempts to join the [From.GetFactionName] outright. It appears that for now, for better or worse, we’ll remain diplomatically isolated from the major powers of Europe."
 serbia.41.a:0 "So much for \"old friendships\"."

 serbia.42.t:0 "Chetniks Rise Up in Bosnia"
 serbia.42.d:0 "The work we put into uniting the various Chetnik groups under the ‘Association of Chetniks’ seemed wasted when we did it, but now it has paid dividends. Following the invasion of Bosnia, Chetnik detachments have risen up behind enemy lines to fight for Serbia! According to the Association, these detachments have been preparing in secret for months, arming and training themselves for the time when our reckoning would begin."
 serbia.42.a:0 "Excellent!"

 serbia.50.t:0 "Old Friends in High Places"
 serbia.50.d:0 "It appears we still have friends within the old "Entente" circles and have managed to secure both the sympathetic ears of both Russia and France (and not those Syndicalist bastards who call themselves French). It appears both have adopted similar concepts in regards to the use of an aerial force, with it designed to support the ground forces. It appears they only differ in how much autonomy they allow their airwings, with the Russian favouring the use of Tactical bombers but are more tied into the Army's command structure, whilst the French the use smaller Fighter-Attacker aircraft, but given the freedom of being attached to an independent airforce."
 serbia.50.a:0 "We will heed the wisdom of our Slavic Brothers."
 serbia.50.b:0 "The French are the masters of the skies."
 serbia.50.c:0 "None are available, unfortunately."

 serbia.51.t:0 "Replacing the Weltkrieg Fleet"
 serbia.51.d:0 "The Serbian Aviation Command is seeking to expand it's air fleet with purchasing new foreign designs to replace its ageing fleet. The French have offered a small about of fighters, with the licence to build them in Serbia. The Russians on the other hand have offered us an entire wing, though we would lack the parts to maintain them efficiently. Lastly, we have been offered Italian mothballed Weltkrieg-era planes, though this offer goes against the reasoning of this request in the first place."
 serbia.51.a:0 "The Russian offer is tempting."
 serbia.51.b:0 "French designs are exactly what we need."
 serbia.51.c:0 "Quantity has a quality of its own."

 serbia.52.t:0 "Ground Support Airwing Acquisition"
 serbia.52.d:0 "With our pilots now showing their worth, we must obtain airframes that reflect our advisors' doctrine."
 serbia.52.a:0 "Look at the size of those bombs!"
 serbia.52.b:0 "French design, so magnifique."
 serbia.52.c:0 "The Italians won't miss a couple of bombers..."

 serbia.53.a:0 "Serbia will never forget its heroes!"

 serbia.54.t:0 "Construction of the Belgrade-Salonica Railway"
 serbia.54.d:0 "Since the end of the 4th Balkan War and our reclamation of Macedonia, Serbian and Greek contractors have been upgrading and connecting the railines from Belgrade to Salonica, which would allow for a continuous journey between the two nations’ heartlands. Today, the first Belgrade-Salonica train journey was undertaken, starting in Serbia and snaking south into Greece. The journey was finished by a meeting of the Serbian and Greek prime ministers, a show of political unity between the Balkan nations."
 serbia.54.a:0 "Serbia will never forget its allies!"

 serbia.55.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy the HMS Lion"
 serbia.55.d:0 "[From.GetName], which is in a process of industrialisation and rearmament, has offered to buy the outdated battlecruiser HMS Lion which will become the flagship of their navy. This will surely lead to better relations with the [From.GetAdjective] government and can help them in taking on the navies of their neighbours."
 serbia.55.a:0 "We could profit from selling this old junk."
 serbia.55.b:0 "No, every ship is needed!"

 serbia.56.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
 serbia.56.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sell us the HMS Lion. The ship is now on its way to our ports. With this addition our navy can reign over the Adriatic Sea."
 serbia.56.a:0 "A day for celebration!"

 serbia.57.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
 serbia.57.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to sell us an old battlecruiser to serve as the flagship of our fleet. We have to search for another solution."
 serbia.57.a:0 "We will remember this."
