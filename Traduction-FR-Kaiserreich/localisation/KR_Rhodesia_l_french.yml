zim.1.t:0 "The Southern Rhodesian Army rises!"
 zim.1.d:0 "Southern Rhodesians have had to hold their patience for years. Ever since we were sold out to appease the Boers of South Africa, we have been lobbying for the province's removal from the union and the establishment of responsible local government.\n\nWe never wanted to use violence to accomplish this goal, but Pretoria left us no choice with their illegal detachment of the Empire. Our electorate shares our concern, and the mobilization of our regiments is so far a great success."
zim.1.a:0 "Rhodesia is forever loyal!"
zim.2.t:0 "Rejoining the Empire"
zim.2.d:0 "We have finally regained our freedom from those South Africans. Now it is time to reassert our loyalty to the Empire again.\n\nRealistically speaking, the overwhelming support we are receiving here in Southern Rhodesia is likely insufficient to actually defend our sovereignty from the Afrikaners and their professional military. Therefore, our envoy, who will be leaving from Mozambique where he will be joined by a representative from Natal, will also request formal recognition by the Empire and seek official reinforcement. We recognize that the focus of the exiles is at the homecoming, we do. But if we, his majesty's loyal subjects from Southern Africa, are to help them fulfil this goal, we will need their help now."
zim.2.a:0 "Safe travels!"
zim.3.t:0 "Imperial Experts"
 zim.3.d:0 "We are seeking the expertise of the wider empire to help develop Southern Rhodesia. The empire has many areas of expertise however, so we ought to choose where we will seek to develop our nation further: in the field of the land military, the air force or economically after all..."
zim.3.a:0 "We are in need of economic development!"
zim.3.b:0 "The army needs better weapons!"
zim.3.c:0 "A more modern air force would be beneficial!"
zim.4.t:0 "Expanding the Native Reserves"
 zim.4.d:0 "When Southern Rhodesia was integrated into South Africa, the region, which historically had a much larger amount of land designated to the Native population, suddenly had to adhere to the South African Native Land Act of 1913 that mandated that the Native Reserve Lands should be brought down to 8% of the total land mass. This threshold was never hit because of the huge disparity, but over the years, native reserve lands shrunk heavily and the reserves have become overcrowded, forcing their inhabitants to similarly overcrowded slums in the urban areas under poor conditions. Now that we are no longer bound to South Africa's legislation, voices have risen to rectify these measures.\n\nHowever a lot of the forfeited reserve lands have been bought by White farmers, and not all of those are willing to vacate their property when the government offers to buy it. Expropriation is an option, but it wouldn't be popular if we expropriate whites in the interest of the natives, so some in the government say we should only recover land voluntarily."
zim.4.a:0 "We will do our best, but we can't expropriate!"
zim.4.b:0 "Every last acre is going back to those reserves."
zim.5.t:0 "[GetYear] General Elections"
 zim.5.d:0 "Now that a constitution has been ratified for our country, it is time to hold elections. Unlike the backwards South African system, any Southern Rhodesian possesses the right to vote so long as they fulfil the property requirements of qualified franchise, although in Southern Rhodesia as well this means most of the electorate is white as they are where the property is concentrated. The main parties contesting the elections are the Rhodesia Party and the Reform Party respectively, although a role for the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party might be in the cards if no single majority is attained in parliament after the election."
zim.5.a:0 "The Rhodesia Party is victorious."
zim.5.b:0 "Reform takes a majority."
zim.5.c:0 "No one takes a majority: parliament is hung."
zim.6.t:0 "The Cabinet Question"
zim.6.d:0 "The Reform Party has already long been a party with internal contradictions: the party has formed out of several left-wing parties, is generally regarded as left-wing as such, and even campaigned on semi-left-wing policies. However, many high-ranking party members, among them party leader Godfrey Huggins, actually subscribe to conservative thought.\n\nHaving won the first elections of independent Southern Rhodesia has rushed this issue to the breaking point: a cabinet now needs to be formed, and it seems likely that Godfrey Huggins will become prime minister. The question is then, whether Huggins will extend an olive branch to the left wing for the good of party unity, or if he will simply only appoint ministers that support his own position."
zim.6.a:0 "Both wings deserve representation!"
zim.6.b:0 "The left wing is misguided!"
zim.7.t:0 "Complaints from Reform's Left Wing"
zim.7.d:0 "The left wing of the Reform Party is growing increasingly dissatisfied: with prime minister Huggins' refusal to appoint left wing ministers in his cabinet, the left wing of the Reform Party has been deprived of most of its influence on the executive and thus government policy.\n\nLead by the wing's leader Thomas Nangle, progressive Reform Party MPs are now up in arms, and threatening to block government legislation if they are not satisfied with it with the Labour Party and the Rhodesia Party."
zim.7.a:0 "Let them scream!"
zim.8.t:0 "The prime minister seeks to dissolve Parliament"
zim.8.d:0 "The Reform Party is quickly tearing itself apart, as left wing opposition to the government of their own party grows increasingly resolute and hinders the government's ability to pass policy severely.\n\nRecognizing that this current situation is untenable, the prime minister has contacted the Rhodesia Party opposition and come to an agreement: his conservative wing will leave the Reform party and form a 'United Rhodesia Party' with the Rhodesia Party, led by Huggins.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in this newfound cooperation to wipe out the progressive reform opposition, the prime minister now petitions the governor to dissolve the Southern Rhodesian Parliament and write new elections. However, it is also clear that the combination right Reform and the Rhodesia Party already have a majority in the current mandate which has been elected just a few months ago..."
zim.8.a:0 "The electorate needs to test this realignment."
zim.8.b:0 "Nothing is wrong with the current mandate."
zim.9.t:0 "[GetYear] Early General Elections"
zim.9.d:0 "Following the fall of the Huggins government and the subsequent realignment between the right Reformists and the Rhodesia Party, the governor has called new elections for the Southern Rhodesian parliament. As is tradition, all Southern Rhodesians who fulfil the property qualifications can vote. It is widely expected that the new United Rhodesia Party will win in a landslide, but the Labour Party and the now much smaller leftover of the Reform Party have been campaigning viciously in the hopes of perhaps enabling themselves to deny this new political behemoth a majority and form a Labour-led coalition between the two parties instead."
zim.9.a:0 "The United Party wins as expected."
zim.9.b:0 "The Labour-Reform coalition secures a surprise victory!"
zim.10.t:0 "Forming a cabinet"
zim.10.d:0 "It turns out the Southern Rhodesian electorate was rather divided, and as such no single party has managed to attain a majority in parliament. The largest plurality belongs to the reform party, who are going to try to form a cabinet as such. The Reform Party has both a left and a right wing though, and unsurprisingly the former wants to form a cabinet with the Labour Party and the latter wants one with the Rhodesia Party. It has devolved into a personal conflict between the party leader Godfrey Huggins and leader of the left Reformists Thomas Nangle. If the latter wins the day, the former will likely not be party leader any longer..."
zim.10.a:0 "Nangle wins the day!"
zim.10.b:0 "Huggins wins the day!"
zim.11.t:0 "Formation of the United Party"
zim.11.d:0 "The coalition between the Rhodesia Party and the Reform Party has been quite beneficial and agreeable to both sides. So much so in fact, that the two parties have announced today that they will unite into a single party: the United Rhodesia Party, under the leadership of prime minister Huggins. The left wing of the Reform party has soundly rejected this notion and claims it will continue what the Reform Party stands for, but they are powerless to stop the government, whose single bloc has a comfortable majority."
zim.11.a:0 "Hurrah for the United Party!"
zim.12.t:0 "Huggins steps down as Party Leader"
zim.12.d:0 "Following the disappointing result for the Reform Party, their leader Godfrey Huggins stepped down as both party leader and official leader of the opposition.\n\nThe Reform party gathered in Bulawayo to elect a new leader for the party, and the choice has fallen on Thomas Nangle, who has been the foremost left-wing MP in the party so far. It might be expected that this will mean the Reform Party will enter a new stage in the future."
zim.12.a:0 "Interesting..."
zim.13.t:0 "[GetYear] General Elections"
zim.13.d:0 "The mandate of the current parliament has run its course and the governor has called elections to renew it. As usual, any Southern Rhodesian possesses the right to vote so long as they fulfil the property requirements of qualified franchise. The Campaigning season closes and the Southern Rhodesians are waiting for incoming results throughout the country..."
zim.13.a:0 "The Rhodesia Party is victorious."

zim.35.t:0 "The Northern Initiative"
 zim.35.d:0 "The now dubbed 'Third Boer war' now becoming a terrible memory, the volunteers from "Northern Rhodesia" have begun to either settle in South Rhodesia or to return home. This fresh wave of immigration has been seen as the silver lining of the war, with the government looking to start an initiative to better integrate and attract more European in Rhodesia. Though spoken in smokey rooms by a small few, the initiative's true goal is the unification of Rhodesia."
zim.35.a:0 "A worthy cause"

 zim.36.t:0 "The Northern Initiative Unintention Benefits"
 zim.36.d:0 "With the Northern Initiative in full swing, it appears the call out has reached out further then the creators of the Initiaive intented. It appears European settlers in Africa, who since the fall of the British Empire have been forced to live under German rule, have now decided to throw their lot in with the new nation of Rhodesia.\n\nAmendments are already being made to the Northern Initiaive, in an attempt to attract more Europeans who have settled in Africa, and a radical expansion of the Initiaive is being drafted. The expansion of the Initiative has taken shape of mandatory military service for 2 years, with housing, and services provided to their family. Oddly, there also seems to be exclusions if one isn't deemed to be fit for military service, or has a skill set that is sort after by the Government. This "skill set" is undefined within the Initiaive's draft, with it's opponents pointing out that one could be able to carry a bucket, and if the Government deems that a sort after skill set, then they are excluded."
 zim.36.a:0 "Clearly that bucket is filled favours and dosh"

 zim.37.t:0 "The Northern Initiative Expansion Scheme"
 zim.37.d:0 "It appears that even with all the efforts made by those behind the Northern Initiative, the new expansion of the scheme has not bore the fruits that were hoped for. It appears most Europeans are not willing to leave their manors, villas, and other large properties, to live in "public housing". The Northern Initiative Expansion Scheme was further kneecapped with the opponents of the Scheme succusfully filling in the gap that was created via the lack of skill set definition within the draft. Though it isn't all bad news, with a younger generation of Europeans making the trek to settle in Rhodesia, with them being happily welcomed"

He went on to congratulate the people of Rhodesia, from all races, creeds, and religions for remaining loyal to the crown, and that they haven't been forgotten. Once this broadcast was over, a second announcement was made with the renaming of the Rhodesian armed forces to "Royal Armed Forces of Rhodesia" and that a march will be held in the evening.\n That evening servicemen and women marched through the streets of Salisbury to much fanfare and celebration. At the end of this, many young men and women were seen at the recruitment stand, to the glee of many recruiting sergeants, who happened to also be in attendance."

The main focus of the talks was commerce and trade with each representatives attempting to gain the best outcome for their nation. The South Rhodesians proposed an 'Economic Reconciliation', which would allow for goods and other capital to flow through each other borders and assist both nations greatly, though South Rhodesia would benefit far greater. Most in the South African delegate still wished to continue with trade tariffs between the nations, though many seeing the benefit in the South Rhodesian proposal.

 zim.44.d:0 "Industrial Conciliation Act draws from its South African counterpart with legislation to exclude blacks and other minorities from certain professions to protect white employees and their interests. The idea of the act is to protect White employees from competition in the labour market compared to the cheaper black employees, who are generally not recognized as workers.\nOf course there are those in the government that see this Act as draconic and backwards compared to something akin to the confederate states of America."
zim.44.a:0 "Pass the act"

zim.45.t:0 "RRWU/Salisbury Municipal Authority"
zim.45.d:0 "With the provincial division now promoted to the status of high court speaking the law of the land, a highly contested court case can finally see its completion by proper procedure.\n\nWhen Southern Rhodesia declared its independence, there was a need for improved rail infrastructure between Salisbury and Mozambique, so as to ensure the young nation’s dependence on South Africa would be reduced. To ensure that these emergency works would be carried out smoothly, the city of Salisbury brought forward a ban against striking, curtailing the power of the powerful railway unions, with the Rhodesian Railway Worker’s Union at its head. The latter contests that Salisbury had the right to do this on the grounds of the Union of South Africa’s Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924, which encompassed Southern Rhodesia but has not been formally repealed, and took to the judiciary to make its point.\n\nThis first decision is doubly important because not only will it reveal whether South African law passed while Southern Rhodesia was under South African dominion still holds, it also sets a precedent on how the newly autonomous colony will be handling the traditionally so powerful railway unions. This court rules in favour of…"

It appears that some of the government managed to flee Lisbon before it fell, and "legally" we should open a more formal dialogue over our actions. Since we are "negotiating" from a position of strength, two options have been forumulated.\n\nThe first, and most popular option is to annex the region, and develop the port for our own use, with a clause to return the region to the Portuguese, though of course with conditions...\n\nThe second, and less popular option, though the more honourable one, is to formally hold the region till the Portuguese government has been restored, though of course with similar conditions as the first option."

 zim.48.t:0 "Portuguese Automony Granted"
 zim.48.d:0 "The Portuguese within Southern Mozambique are in a very similar boat to the common Rhodesian, with that boat being a white European in Africa. With this in mind, replacing the current Portuguese adminstration would only serve to disbenefit both ourselves and the Portuguese. That said, the Portuguese are also seeking a level of representation with Rhodesia as a whole, to the annoyance of those in Salisbury.\n\nWhilst the finer details are beomg hammered out, a level of automony has been given to the Portuguese in the adminstration of Southern Mozambique, though of course so long as said adminstration doesn't interfere the trade in Lourenço Marques."

With about 25.000 whites, almost exclusively Portuguese, the representation would be expected to be about 3 constituencies, to be elected with the provincial council: Lourenço Marques, Gaza and Ciszambesia. Notably the government has chosen to grant official status to Portuguese in the province of South East Africa, in addition to English and Dutch/Afrikaans to which official use is reserved in our other provinces. The latter clearly an overture to our South African friends, in an effort to promote trade within the region"
