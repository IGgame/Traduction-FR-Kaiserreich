 NFA_seize_morocco_decisions:0 "Saisissons les Territoires Marocains"
 NFA_seize_morocco_decisions_desc:0 "Depuis le XIXe siècle, nous nourrissons des ambitions sur le Maroc. Maintenant que les autres puissances qui ont un intérêt dans la région sont dans la tourmente, il est temps de nous emparer de ces terres. Vive la France !"
 NFA_seize_real_morocco:0 "Reprenons le Royaume du Maroc !"
 NFA_seize_real_morocco_desc:0 "Les Allemands ont perdu la guerre en Europe, et c'est maintenant à nous de frapper et de reprendre ce qui nous appartenait !"
 NFA_seize_spanish_morocco:0 "Saisissons le Rio Del Oro espagnol !"
 NFA_seize_spanish_morocco_desc:0 "La CNT-FAI a capturé l'Espagne et par la même occasion ses anciennes colonies à Rio del Oro. Si nous voulons sécuriser la région, nous devons frapper maintenant, tant que les anarchistes sont encore en difficulté."
 NFA_help_spain_decisions:0 "La Guerre Civile Espagnole"
 NFA_help_spain_decisions_desc:0 "L’Espagne est au bord de l’instabilité depuis des décennies et elle a maintenant franchi le pas. D'un côté, les anarchistes impies de la CNT. D'autre part, les prétendants Carlistes, soutenus par nos alliés Intégralistes Portugais, et un allié probable à son tour s'il réussit. Et, enfin, le gouvernement légitime d’Alphonse XIII, détesté par le peuple mais un bon ami des Allemands. Quel côté devrions-nous soutenir ?"
 NFA_help_kos:0 "Soutenir le Gouvernement Légitime"
 NFA_help_kos_desc:0 "La seule façon pour l'Espagne d'atteindre la véritable paix et la démocratie est par le triomphe du véritable gouvernement des Bourbons."
 NFA_help_car:0 "Soutenir les Carlistes"
 NFA_help_car_desc:0 "Les Carlistes sont la seule voie que l'Espagne a pour redevenir vertueuse. Les Portugais nous ont convaincus que c'est la bonne faction à soutenir et, si nous les soutenons, ils pourraient certainement rejoindre notre alliance s'ils réussissent ?"

 NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "Après notre défaite dans la Weltkrieg de 1919, les communards se sont soulevés de nouveau et ont aboli notre chère République. Heureusement, certaines des personnalités les plus importantes de la République ont immigré en Algérie où elles prévoient d'organiser la contre-révolution. Maintenant que les traîtres syndicalistes ont pris le contrôle total de la métropole, nous devons les écraser ! Nous devons nous assurer que notre France Éternelle sera toujours libre ! "
 NFA_french_in_exile:0 "La France en Exil"

 NFA_political_unrest:0 "Troubles Politiques"
 NFA_political_unrest_desc:0 "Malgré les meilleurs efforts de notre gouvernement militaire, le mécontentement augmente au sein de la population de la Quatrième République. Les récentes bavures politiques du Premier Ministre Maurice Janin ont forcé le maréchal Petain à chercher un remplaçant. Cependant, les observateurs craignent que le simple fait de changer le Premier Ministre ne suffise pas à apaiser la population.

### Focuses ###
 NFA_industrial_revival:0 "Expansion Industrielle"
 NFA_industrial_revival_desc:0 "Notre industrie ici en Afrique est loin derrière celle des communards sur le continent. Si nous voulons les vaincre, nous devrons renforcer considérablement notre industrie."
 NFA_sahara_census:0 "Commencer le Recensement et l'Inventaire Saharien"
 NFA_sahara_census_desc:0 "Le Gouvernement Français en Exil a connu une situation économique difficile qui a conduit à plusieurs projets farfelus afin d'obtenir plus de fonds. Un jeune esprit brillant d'une agence gouvernementale a eu l'idée de faire un recensement et un inventaire de la région du Sahara. Nous devrions envoyer des représentants du gouvernement et des expéditions pour sonder la région."
 NFA_sahara_census_tooltip:0 "Le Recensement et l'Inventaire Algérie-Afrique Centrale vont commencer...\n"
 NFA_inventory_progress:0 "L'Inventaire Algérie-Afrique Centrale est terminé."
 NFA_transsaharian:0 "Le Chemin de Fer Transsaharien"
 NFA_transsaharian_desc:0 "Un élément clé de notre stratégie consiste à améliorer les liens entre l'Afrique du Nord et l'Afrique de l'Ouest, particulièrement avec notre base à Dakar. Pour résoudre ce problème, le projet de chemin de fer reliant directement Alger à Dakar a déjà été lancé sous la Troisième République mais le projet a finalement été abandonné, c'est maintenant à notre tour de reprendre ce flambeau et de réussir là où nos prédécesseurs ont échoué !"
 building_transaharian_tooltip:0 "Nous allons commencer la construction d'un chemin de fer reliant Dakar à Alger.\n"
 NFA_develop_ALG:0 "Routes Départementales"
 NFA_develop_ALG_desc:0 "Avant de penser à augmenter notre production industrielle, nous devons améliorer (et dans certains cas, créer à partir de rien) l'infrastructure des départements Algériens. Malheureusement, ils sont loin d'être aussi développés que nous l'espérions."
 NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG:0 "Dirigisme"
 NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG_desc:0 "Avant notre défaite contre la vermine rouge, l'Algérie était la colonie la plus développée de tout notre empire - mais c'était tout de même une colonie, avec une faible capacité industrielle. L'absence flagrante d'apport financier n'a pas amélioré la situation. Nous devrions subventionner les entreprises publiques pour atténuer ce problème."
 NFA_military_factories_ALG:0 "Industrie de Guerre Algérienne"
 NFA_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "Pour reconquérir notre Patrie, nous devons produire plus d'armes que les traîtres contre nous. Financer de nouvelles usines devrait nous aider à réduire la différence entre nous et eux."
 NFA_more_military_factories_ALG:0 "Agrandir l'Industrie Métallurgique"
 NFA_more_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "Les mines et les usines nouvellement créées nous permettront de construire une grande industrie métallurgique destinée à approvisionner notre armée."
 NFA_dakar_algiers_airway:0 "La Compagnie Aérienne Dakar-Alger"
 NFA_dakar_algiers_airway_desc:0 "La Compagnie Aérienne Dakar-Alger était le fruit du travail de Louis Breguet et a été conçue pour relancer l'économie dans le sud du pays. La concurrence avec les entreprises Allemandes et Sud-Africaines avait été un problème pour les entreprises françaises en difficulté et Breguet voulait les aider. Il espérait qu'une nouvelle compagnie aérienne pourrait apporter plus d'affaires en Afrique du Nord."
 NFA_expand_airway:0 "Agrandir la Compagnie Aérienne"
 NFA_expand_airway_desc:0 "Le succès de la Compagnie Dakar-Alger a conduit Breguet à vouloir l'étendre à toute l'Afrique. Breguet souhaite s'étendre dans toutes les directions, mais nous courons le risque que la Compagnie ne s'étire trop. Devrions-nous le faire quand même ?"
 NFA_improve_maritime_links:0 "Améliorer les Liaisons Maritimes"
 NFA_improve_maritime_links_desc:0 "La cohésion entre notre industrie Algérienne et les exploitations d'Afrique de l'Ouest repose largement sur la qualité des infrastructures qui relient les deux parties. En développant et en améliorant les liaisons maritimes entre elles, nous pouvons espérer une base industrielle plus efficace."
 NFA_develop_mines:0 "Ouvrir de Nouvelles Mines"
 NFA_develop_mines_desc:0 "La première étape de l'exploitation de nos actifs en Afrique de l'Ouest s'est avérée fructueuse. Nous devrions augmenter le nombre de mines et commencer à construire des raffineries basiques de métaux pour soutenir un développement plus poussé."
 NFA_colonial_resources:0 "Exploitation Coloniale"
 NFA_colonial_resources_desc:0 "Si nous voulons alimenter notre industrie, nous avons besoin de ressources. Heureusement, nos exploitations d'Afrique de l'Ouest sont remplies de fer, d'aluminium et autres métaux ! Si nous creusons de nouvelles mines et faisons travailler les gens pour nous (volontairement ou non), nous pourrions améliorer nos finances et réduire la dépendance de notre industrie à l'égard des approvisionnements étrangers !"
 NFA_cotton_mali:0 "Coton Soudanais"
 NFA_cotton_mali_desc:0 "Récemment, un ingénieur français exilé en Afrique a fait pression en faveur d'une idée folle pour développer nos colonies et faire de nouveaux profits. Emile Bélime assure que la vallée du Niger au Soudan Français est un excellent endroit pour cultiver le coton et pour concurrencer même les plus grands producteurs aux États-Unis ou en Égypte. Malgré notre perplexité initiale, nous pourrions essayer et lui donner les fonds."
 NFA_sahara:0 "Exploiter le Pétrole Saharien"
 NFA_sahara_desc:0 "Le Sahara est grand et vide, mais peut-être pas aussi vide que nous le pensions ? De nombreuses tribus berbères vivent au plus profond de ces territoires où notre portée ne s'étend pas complètement. Avec des traces de pétrole trouvées dans le territoire, le Sahara pourrait être la solution à beaucoup de nos problèmes si nous l'exploitons !"
 NFA_algerie_refinery:0 "Raffineries Algériennes"
 NFA_algerie_refinery_desc:0 "Le pétrole Saharien couvre la plupart de nos besoins mais nous pourrions augmenter considérablement notre production avec le développement des raffineries sur la Côte Méditerranéenne."
 NFA_extra_research_slot:0 "Nouvelles Infrastructures de Recherche"
 NFA_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "De jeunes esprits prometteurs apparaissent partout. Nous devons leur fournir les infrastructures nécessaires pour mener leurs recherches. Les progrès technologiques peuvent nous donner l'avantage dont nous avons besoin pour reconquérir notre Patrie."

 NFA_Darlan_Focus:0 "Le Plan Darlan"
 NFA_Darlan_Focus_desc:0 "La Stratégie Générale de l'État Français suivra les conseils de l'amiral Darlan, en se concentrant sur la défense de nos possessions contre les possibles menaces, au lieu de risquer imprudemment nos forces sur les terres ennemies."
 NFA_fortification_focus:0 "Standardisation des Fortifications"
 NFA_fortification_focus_desc:0 "Il est impératif que nous ne soyons pas surpris par les débarquements ennemis. Si nous voulons mieux défendre nos positions, il serait judicieux de standardiser les fortifications afin de réduire les délais de construction. Plus vite on aura nos fortifications, mieux ce sera."
 NFA_mediteranean_forts:0 "Protéger le Littoral"
 NFA_mediteranean_forts_desc:0 "La tâche la plus importante de notre industrie est de fortifier lourdement la côte Méditerranéenne afin de créer une forteresse à l'abri des Communards et de leurs laquais !"
 NFA_protect_the_air:0 "Protection Aérienne"
 NFA_protect_the_air_desc:0 "Nos fortifications côtières seront sans valeur si le ciel est contrôlé par nos ennemis, nos forces harcelées par leurs attaques aériennes et nos industries réduites à néant."
 NFA_radar_effort:0 "Développer la Technologie Radar"
 NFA_radar_effort_desc:0 "La dernière technologie en matière de détection est le soi-disant RADAR. Si nous installions des radars le long de la côte Nord Africaine, nous pourrions détecter toute invasion à travers la Méditerranée alors qu'elle était encore en phase de planification !"
 NFA_aviation_home_defense:0 "Aviation : Priorité à la Défense Nationale"
 NFA_aviation_home_defense_desc:0 "La guerre aérienne dans les zones désertiques est très différente de la guerre aérienne sur le continent européen. Nous devons tenir compte de tous les détails dans la conception de notre force aérienne."
 NFA_cas_effort:0 "Effort sur l'Appui Aérien Rapproché"
 NFA_cas_effort_desc:0 "N'ayant nulle part où se cacher dans les plaines ouvertes d'Afrique du Nord, les unités d'infanterie et même de blindés sont très exposées aux attaques aériennes. L'appui aérien rapproché sèmera la mort et fauchera n'importe quelle formation ennemie !"
 NFA_navy_expansion:0 "Expansion de la Marine Française"
 NFA_navy_expansion_desc:0 "Nous ne devons pas laisser nos ennemis s'approcher de nos côtes et menacer notre havre : la Marine Française doit être élargie et notre emprise sur la mer sécurisée !"
 NFA_navy_expansion_tooltip:0 "Cette priorité déverrouillera des événements donnant gratuitement de nouveaux navires.\n"
 NFA_dockyard_focus:0 "Expansion des Chantiers Navals de Dakar"
 NFA_dockyard_focus_desc:0 "Nous avons dû construire des chantiers navals à partir de zéro à la suite de la perte de la France. Dakar a été choisi pour accueillir nos bases sous-marines et nous pensons qu'ils doivent être agrandis afin que nous puissions rivaliser avec nos ennemis en Méditerranée."
 NFA_naval_doctrine:0 "Étudier de Nouvelles Tactiques"
 NFA_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Darlan a envoyé certains de ses officiers les plus brillants à l'étranger, au Japon et au Canada, pour étudier les plus récentes connaissances en matière de guerre navale."
 NFA_destroyer_focus:0 "Priorité aux Destroyers"
 NFA_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Bien que de grands cuirassés auraient été préférables, il est malheureusement irréaliste d'essayer de les construire avec notre capacité industrielle actuelle. Les destroyers modernes sont mieux adaptés à nos besoins."
 NFA_light_cruiser_focus:0 "Priorité aux Croiseurs Légers"
 NFA_light_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Les Croiseurs Légers devraient constituer le cœur de notre flotte moderne et spécialisée. Ils ne coûtent pas cher à construire mais peuvent, malgré leur poids, causer de lourds dégâts aux navires et aux avions ennemis."
 NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus:0 "Priorité aux Croiseurs Lourds"
 NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Les croiseurs lourds sont des navires clés dans toute flotte puissante destinée à dominer un océan. Si nous pouvons bien focaliser notre industrie de guerre, nous devrions être en mesure de produire un nombre suffisant de ces navires redoutables pour contrôler nos eaux territoriales."
 NFA_battleship_focus:0 "Priorité aux Cuirassés"
 NFA_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Pour vaincre nos ennemis, nous devrons les détruire dans des combats décisifs. Quelles meilleures armes que les cuirassés pour gagner ce combat ?"

 NFA_DeGaulle_focus:0 "Plan De Gaulle"
 NFA_DeGaulle_focus_desc:0 "Le Haut Commandement Militaire suivra les recommandations du Général de Gaulle, en se concentrant sur la construction de nos forces militaires pour reprendre notre Patrie."
 NFA_southern_conscription:0 "Conscription dans le Sud"
 NFA_southern_conscription_desc:0 "La France Nationale a de sérieuses difficultés d'effectifs. La réputation de l'armée française a été ternie par son échec dans la Weltkrieg et le volontariat n'a jamais été aussi bas. Un Français férocement national ne peut pas être la seule source de d'effectifs et d'autres sources sont nécessaires. Le gouvernement se tourne vers les gens du sud du pays."
 NFA_native_conscription:0 "Conscription des Autochtones"
 NFA_native_conscription_desc:0 "La façon la plus simple d'augmenter le nombre d'hommes disponibles est d'enrôler les locaux dans notre armée et de les faire combattre pour nous. C'était une solution que le Haut-Commandement hésitait à mettre en œuvre en raison du risque de sédition de ces nouvelles unités."
 NFA_native_conscription_tooltip:0 "Vous gagnerez 2 Divisions de Cavalerie à Constantine et 4 Divisions d'Infanterie au Soudan Français.\n"
 NFA_continue_native_conscription:0 "Poursuivre la Conscription des Autochtones"
 NFA_continue_native_conscription_desc:0 "Si le recrutement dans les provinces du Nord s'est heurté à la résistance du Parlement, nous n'avons toujours pas assez d'hommes. Nous pourrions étendre la conscription au sud, en comptant non seulement sur les Arabes mais aussi sur les Africains Subsahariens. Elle devrait nous accorder les effectifs dont nous avons cruellement besoin, mais il faudra beaucoup d'efforts politiques pour s'en sortir."
 NFA_native_conscription2_tooltip:0 "Vous gagnerez 1 Division de Cavalerie à Constantine et 5 Divisions d'Infanterie au Soudan Français.\n"
 NFA_legionary_campaign:0 "Renforcer la Légion Étrangère"
 NFA_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "Pour augmenter nos forces armées, nous pourrions augmenter la taille de la Légion Étrangère. En accueillant les valeureux combattants anti-syndicalistes du monde entier, notre Armée pourrait devenir le fléau de l'Hydre Rouge !"
 NFA_legionary_campaign_tooltip:0 "Vous gagnerez 3 Divisions d'Infanterie à Alger.\n"
 NFA_continue_legionary_campaign:0 "Étendre la Campagne de Recrutement"
 NFA_continue_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "Les Irlandais, les Américains, les Italiens, les Espagnols et les Portugais seront encouragés dans de vastes campagnes de propagande étrangère à se joindre à nos braves Forces anti-syndicalistes !"
 NFA_legionary_campaign2_tooltip:0 "Vous gagnerez 3 Divisions d'Infanterie à Alger.\n"
 NFA_aviation_invasion:0 "Aviation : Priorité à l'Invasion "
 NFA_aviation_invasion_desc:0 "Pour envahir un pays de l'autre côté de la mer, nous devrons compter sur des bombardiers de précision à longue distance, capables d'atteindre les lignes d'approvisionnement et les réserves avant qu'elles n'atteignent les ports."
 NFA_aviation_doctrine:0 "Une Nouvelle Génération d'Officiers"
 NFA_aviation_doctrine_desc:0 "Les soi-disant Jeunes Gardes, jeunes hommes capables et brillants de France, ont de nombreuses idées révolutionnaires sur la façon de mener la guerre."
 NFA_naval_bomber_focus:0 "Contrôler la Mer depuis les Airs."
 NFA_naval_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Bien que nous ne puissions pas nous permettre de construire une flotte capable de rivaliser avec celle de nos ennemis, nous pouvons concevoir des bombardiers navals capables de contrôler la Méditerranée assez longtemps pour amorcer un débarquement sur le continent."
 NFA_paratrooper_focus:0 "Fonder les Troupes Aéroportées"
 NFA_paratrooper_focus_desc:0 "Les Jeunes Gardes nous ont présenté une idée nouvelle et audacieuse. Une infanterie légèrement appuyée pourrait être larguée par avions derrière les lignes ennemies et isoler des sites tactiquement importants."
 NFA_invasion_navy:0 "Une Marine d'Invasion"
 NFA_invasion_navy_desc:0 "Notre marine est archaïque et pourrait, au mieux, empêcher les Rouges de débarquer en Afrique du Nord. Nous devons contrôler la mer si nous voulons réussir l'invasion du sud de la France."
 NFA_naval_invasion_focus:0 "Les Vaisseaux de la Libération"
 NFA_naval_invasion_focus_desc:0 "Nous ne pouvons nous contenter d'une marine capable de se battre. Nous avons aussi besoin d'une grande flotte de convois, capable de nourrir nos armées une fois que nous aurons commencé à libérer le sud de la France."
 NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle:0 "Priorité aux Cuirassés"
 NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle_desc:0 "Les cuirassés peuvent se montrer coûteux, mais personne ne peut nier le rôle important qu'ils jouent dans la guerre navale et dans les débarquements amphibies. Leurs gros canons peuvent réduire toute résistance locale en poussière avant même que l'infanterie de marine n'atteignent la plage !"
 NFA_submarine_focus:0 "Priorité aux Sous-Marins"
 NFA_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Les sous-marins sont peu coûteux et fonctionnent parfaitement pour escorter ou intercepter les lignes de convois."
 NFA_carrier_effort:0 "Effort sur les Porte-Avions"
 NFA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Les porte-avions sont des projets navals massifs et coûteux à entreprendre.... Mais si nous parvenons à en construire quelques-uns et à les protéger avec des navires d'escorte, notre marine passera d'une relique obsolète du passé à une des plus redoutées que le monde connaît."

 NFA_restore_constitution:0 "Restaurer la Constitution Suspendue"
 NFA_restore_constitution_desc:0 "La Troisième République s'est terminée comme elle a commencée, par une défaite contre les Allemands. Après le soulèvement Communard et l'évasion vers l'Afrique, la Constitution a été suspendue par Joffre et plus tard Pétain. Peut-être est-il temps de mettre fin au régime militaire et de reformer nos véritables idéaux de démocratie Française ?"
 NFA_restore_constitution_tooltip:0 "§RVous restaurerez une 4ème République démocratique.§!\n"
 NFA_monarchy:0 "Restaurer le Royaume de France"
 NFA_monarchy_desc:0 "C'est un fait établi que la France a beaucoup souffert sous des gouvernements disjoints. Une personnalité forte pourrait agir en tant que chef d'État permanent et offrir la stabilité à notre nation, en particulier si nous maintenons un parlement fort aux côtés du Roi. Bien qu'il puisse être tentant de rêver des jours de gloire du Roi Soleil et de restaurer la monarchie Française dans toute sa splendeur."
 NFA_monarchy_tooltip:0 "§RVous restaurerez une monarchie dirigée par la maison d'Orléans.§!\n"
 NFA_empire:0 "Restaurer l'Empire Français"
 NFA_empire_desc:0 "Les rois et les gouvernements démocratiquement élus ont tous deux trahi la France. Sous le règne de Napoléon, l'Europe était dominée par le fier peuple Français, mais même s'il est installé, nous devons déterminer si le pouvoir doit revenir à l'Empereur ou au Parlement. Quoi qu'il en soit, Vive l'Empereur !"
 NFA_empire_tooltip:0 "§RVous restaurerez un Empire dirigé par Napoléon IV.§!\n"
 NFA_Petain_president:0 "Continuation de la Présidence de Pétain"
 NFA_Petain_president_desc:0 "L'annonce de la démocratisation du régime a prise de nombreuses personnes par surprise. Bien que le Maréchal Pétain soit à l'origine de la réforme, il est normalement contraint d'abdiquer son rôle de président. Mais il pourrait facilement conserver sa position en tirant simplement quelques ficelles..."

 NFA_Judiciary_reform:0 "Égalité devant la Loi"
 NFA_Judiciary_reform_desc:0 "La Constitution de la IVe République Française a prévu une Haute Cour indépendante, mais elle n'a jamais été implémentée.

 NFA_judiciary_frenchmen:0 "Tribunaux Coloniaux"
 NFA_judiciary_frenchmen_desc:0 "La Constitution de la IVe République Française a prévu une Haute Cour indépendante, mais elle n'a jamais été implémentée. Il faut réaffirmer que Français et colonisés ne sont pas égaux devant la loi en réaffirmant l'existence de tribunaux coloniaux pour les locaux."
 NFA_extended_suffrage:0 "Suffrage Étendu"
 NFA_extended_suffrage_desc:0 "Les prochaines élections nous obligent à délimiter qui pourra voter. Traditionnellement, les colonisés ne pouvaient pas voter, laissant l'assemblée Algérienne dominée par la minorité Pied-Noir.

 NFA_limited_suffrage:0 "Suffrage des Pieds-Noirs"
 NFA_limited_suffrage_desc:0 "Certains locaux ont demandé à voter aux prochaines élections en tant que citoyens de la République Française. Il faut réaffirmer que seuls les Français peuvent voter, et non les peuples inférieurs des colonies !"
 NFA_Constitutionalism:0 "Monarchie Constitutionnelle"
 NFA_Constitutionalism_desc:0 "Le rétablissement de notre chef d'État a permis au peuple Français d'être plus uni, mais notre chef sait qu'il ne peut gouverner seul, et la plus grande partie de l'ancienne Constitution sera utilisée pour le nouveau régime."

nfa.1.t:0 "The situation of National France in 1936"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Communist Revolution at home. In the aftermath of the French Communal Revolution, the whole apparatus of state and French military, sheltered in Marseille, quickly embarked with the French Navy to Algiers, fleeing the newly created Commune of France. After the peace negotiations with Germany, the French refugee politicians decided to start from scratch again, proclaiming the French Fourth Republic, in exile in Africa but claiming the French motherland. Soon, it was obvious that the parliamentarian regime was outdated, as the exiled leading politicians were mainly nationalists and authoritarian : the military subsequently seized the executive powers, under the leadership of popular marshal Ferdinand Foch. After his death in 1929, the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain, took his place, helped by his protégé, admiral François Darlan. Although the military regime of the French Republic in exile, still allied with the British monarchy in exile, has coalesced and stabilised, it still faces numerous threats.

The day after, the military broke in and arrested all of those in sight, the hideout was sacked and all evidences were recuperated, 17 Algerian nationalists and the young Pied-Noir, Albert Camus of his name were brought to the police station.\nDuring an initial interrogation, Albert swore he never did anything to actually help the Algerians but were merely observing them, this stance wasn't very convincing but it will be for the court to judge."

His successor will be less the subject of the praises of our government, Moncef Bey as he is called now has been known since more than 15 years to hold very nationalist opinions and to have worked closely with members of the nationalist party Destour before the party got banned in the early 1920's. Needless to say he will try to further his cause to the French authorities and is likely to cause us problems, the resident-general in Tunisia and our officials will have to stay in a state of alert."

If the previous Bey accepted this without batting an eye it's not the same for the new nationalist Bey, he formally denounced what he sees as exploitation of the Tunisian people for French wars that do not concern them and asked to put a stop to the conscription in Tunisia. While we still have important power over him, his symbolic authority is strong and the Bey is loved and respected amongst the population. At the end of his speech, it was obvious he was trying to open a dialogue between the French authorities and him, should we try to talk with him or should we just ignore his complaint, as powerless as he is?"

Of course this protest was completely illegal and was accompanied by several acts of violence, furthermore their positions are not one to please our point of view.

This afternoon in Constantine, a protest of radical nationalist elements degenerated as protesters and policemen fought each other in the streets, destroying the glasses of several shops and frightening the neighbours, no-one can say who started this disaster but one thing is sure: it has to be stopped.

In this area, our policy looked successful at first but we are now seeing the disadvantages of it. Indeed, our actions radicalised a part of the nationalist movement heavily and even if they are condemned by a large part of the Algerian opposition they still have enough power to be dangerous and already threatened us of leading a struggle to death for the independence of Algeria.

The market of Constantine has been devastated by a bomb posed by an Algerian terrorist and in the panic, we could count 15, or 16, maybe 17 deaths. The injured have been transported to the hospital quickly but the population is shocked. This is the first terror attack of the radicalised Algerian nationalists, they claim that Constantine was legitimate to be striked first due to being the centre of the repression against their brothers during the protests. More moderate elements condemned this attack but it didn't prevent the growing resentment of the Pied-Noirs against the Algerians, terrorists or not. The Government announced a new crackdown on known nationalist cells and swore that the culprits will be arrested."

Conflicts between the colonial government and the natives over these, the government seeing it as an obstacle for the development of the country, have always existed but had lead to compromises. When in Tunisia private habous weren't touched and public habous were put to location under a bid system called the 'enzel', in Algeria public habous were regularly seized by the government following its need but here too private habous were untouched. But despite this status several habous properties in the region of Algiers and Bône are blocking off the ambitious industrialisation plans of the government, unable to sell them due to Islamic law the only other possibility would be to seize them by force. This would surely anger some people but it would help greatly our industry in the region."

nfa.128.t:0 "Which workers for the railroad?"
nfa.128.d:0 "Now that we symbolically started the construction of the railroad we have to ask ourselves which type of workforce we want to use in majority for this project. We could bring in skilled workers from Algeria, either Pied-Noirs or skilled natives, surely they will be very efficient but they will also be very costly in wages and maintenance, building houses and giving them enough food and protection won't be free. Alternatively we could use a more volatile force of volunteers from Algeria or from bordering countries, usually poor people looking for a job, these workers won't be as efficient as their skilled counterparts but offer the advantage of being easier to please and of not complaining as much. Finally there is the possibility of forcefully bringing in labourforce from our colonies in Black Africa, they obviously have the advantage of not costing anything and of being 'satisfied' with very poor working conditions, they are also a disposable workforce as if some disappear, we can just bring more; the drawback of this choice is that they also are neither efficient or motivated for their job."
nfa.128.a:0 "Use well-paid skill workers."
nfa.128.b:0 "Use underpaid volunteers, from Algeria or beyond!"
nfa.128.c:0 "Force the natives in West Africa to work for us!"
nfa.129.t:0 "Sandstorm!"
nfa.129.d:0 "A violent sandstorm broke out in the middle of the desert during the construction of the railroad. Not happy of seriously delaying the construction, the sandstorm also damaged several temporary houses and made us lose some tools. Consequently the construction has been delayed."
nfa.129.a:0 "The construction takes a hit."
nfa.130.t:0 "A River on the Path"
nfa.130.d:0 "During the planning phase of the project rivers were carefully noted and marked on a map and the construction planned for it in advance but upon seeing this river, something was wrong. It was way higer than normal! Our engineers and geographers didn't take into account the potential rise of the water and we are now stuck with a river we can't cross for now. We'll have to wait for better equipment."
nfa.130.a:0 "Not a problem for our talented workers."
nfa.130.b:0 "That will surely slow down the process."
nfa.130.c:0 "We didn't plan for this!"
nfa.131.t:0 "The workers complain of their working conditions"
nfa.131.d:0 "Disaster on the construction of the railway! The labourforce stopped working and are complaining of their 'terrible' working conditions, would it be their accommodation, malaria or the direction of the works that they think is too harsh. They are saying they won't start the work again until their conditions are improved, but they will surely get to work again one day if we just ignore it."
nfa.131.a:0 "Agree to their demands."
nfa.131.b:0 "Let them shout!"
nfa.132.t:0 "The project is lacking workers"
nfa.132.d:0 "The reputation of the construction of the railways is well-known throughout our neighbours, the working conditions in the desert and under brutal directors are terrible and the wages aren't worth it. We are consequently having more and more problems recruiting workers as no one wants to go to this hell. This problem has to be solved for the construction to continue properly, we could make an effort to improve their conditions slightly and recruit more people or we could bet on a temporary scare that we can ignore, thirdly we could scrap this recruiting project and start recruiting Africans... with our own ways."
nfa.132.a:0 "Make an effort to recruit more."
nfa.132.b:0 "It will surely go better one day."
nfa.132.c:0 "Enough! Switch to African workers!"
nfa.133.t:0 "Our workers are decimated!"
nfa.133.d:0 "A massacre. There is no other word to describe what is happening during this construction. The foremen are mercilessly beating up the workers when they judge they aren't doing enough, hundreds are dying of exhaustion, malaria, or under the beatings of the managers, the labourforce is totally demoralised and we are now lacking people to finish the railway. Our forced recruitment in African villages isn't even working anymore, people are doing anything to avoid being recruited. Should we make our recruitment policies harsher or should we wait until all is forgotten?"
nfa.133.a:0 "Throw more men at the problem!"
nfa.133.b:0 "It will surely go better one day."
nfa.134.t:0 "Leaflets in the street"
nfa.134.d:0 "'Tunisia is a free nation!', this is the odious statement written on one of the leaflet found in the largest arteries of Tunis today, all signed by the nationalist party Destour. Hundreds of them have been dispersed through the capital and removed as quickly as possible by the French authorities. Their influence on the Tunisian people has surely been minimal due to their quick removal but it still shows a significant revival of Tunisian nationalism which we thought was reduced to small inactive groups of the countryside after our action against them in the 20's.\nThe fact that they didn't fear anything by leaving these leaflets show, more than their arrogance, that they gained a level of passive agreement with either the population or the official authorities of the Protectorate. This conclusion quickly led us to investigate the links of the Bey with these groups and we find some small parts and testimonies that, while not enough to depose the Bey altogether, are enough to confront him about this treason. Should we try to confront him or let the matter drop?"
nfa.134.a:0 "Confront the Bey."
nfa.134.b:0 "Ignore this... for now."
nfa.135.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.135.d:0 "The Bey answered to the concerns brought by our Resident-General by assuring that never would he fund or facilitate the action of these 'fighters' according to his own words. He found it shocking that we could even accuse him of it but, he has said, is willing to forget about that if we are ready to consider him better. Many in our administration is doubting these claims as the Bey never hid his nationalist tendencies but some think he wouldn't endanger his throne by funding terrorists and that he must be honest. Which side are we on?"
nfa.135.a:0 "Trust him..."
nfa.135.b:0 "He is decieving us, warn him for his actions."
nfa.136.t:0 "Tunisian Unions"
nfa.136.d:0 "The creation of the first Tunisian unions date back to the awakening of Tunisian nationalism in the 20's before the ban on unions applied in Algeria was applied in Tunisia too. These unions, led by Mohammed Ali Hammi knew the same fate than the nationalit leaders and were heavily repressed and dismantled while Hammi died in prison in 1934. We thought this would forever be the end of Tunisian trade unionism until we heard of clandestine trade unions reappearing in their bastion of Sfax in the south of Tunisia and slowly spreading amongst immigrants of the south in northern cities. The main representative of these new unions is named 'General Association of the Tunisian Workers' and is led by Tahar Haddad, known for being a nationalist and therefore uniting two of our greatest enemies.\nIt's obvious that this corrupt organisation must be taken down, what if it was helped by Communard spies and agitators? Something surprising though is that the Tunisian authorities didn't already strike on them, they usually know about these sorts of events before us. This bizarre fact boosted the doubts on the Bey again and some of high-ranking officials want to ask him to crackdown on the unionists himself to see if he is being honest or not. What should we do?"
nfa.136.a:0 "Crackdown on them ourselves!"
nfa.136.b:0 "Ask the Bey to make it stop."
nfa.136.c:0 "Ignore it."
nfa.137.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.137.d:0 "The Bey, confronted by our Resident-General refused to crackdown on the unions, citing a 'lack of proofs' and 'only rumours'. This indifference greatly angered the most high-ranking representatives of France in Tunisia and calls for an increased pressure on the Bey have arisen. This anyway won't prevent us to destroy these unions ourselves."
nfa.137.a:0 "Warn the Bey about his obedience and crackdown on the unions!"
nfa.137.b:0 "This was the last warning, ask him to step down."
nfa.137.c:0 "Back down..."
nfa.138.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.138.d:0 "Great News! The Bey isn't as corrupt by the nationalist ideology as we thought and agreed to repress the unions, he seemed visibly angered of it happening on his territory and this makes us hope for a more constructive relationship in the future."
nfa.138.a:0 "Good."
nfa.139.t:0 "The Bey steps down!"
nfa.139.d:0 "Surprisingly the Bey agreed to step down and leave the place to his relative Lamine Bey, he accepted his political defeat and stepped down to, he says, spare a bloodshed that would have hurt the Tunisian people. Though, he obtained to be treated with all the honours a former Bey should receive."
nfa.139.a:0 "Long live Lamine Bey!"
nfa.140.t:0 "The Bey refuses to step down"
nfa.140.d:0 "The Bey was shocked by our demand and refused to step down as the monarch of Tunisia citing his right to govern that was given by its people and Allah himself. Seeing it as a direct agression he called all the Tunisians to arm and mobilised what he could of nationalist militias he had links to drive out the French from Tunisia forever. While we are reporting this, the Beylical Guard is fighting fiercefully with the French garrison in Tunis."
nfa.140.a:0 "Is it a revolt?"
nfa.141.t:0 "The dockers's strike"
nfa.141.d:0 "The dockers of the port of Tunis, mainly coming from the south of Tunisia, bastion of the the unions, striked today, claiming better wages and working conditions. This subsersive demonstration and opening to syndicalist agitators is unacceptable and must be stopped at all costs but we have two options to deal with them. We could send the army and do it by force, potentially angering the Tunisians and destroying industrial assets in the fight or we could negotiate better conditions with them, this would surely stop the strike but it would be a huge thorn in our pride and the elite circles of Algeria would greatly disapprove this policy."
nfa.141.a:0 "Send the army."
nfa.141.b:0 "Negotiate with them."
nfa.142.t:0 "The great Tunisian protest"
nfa.142.d:0 "Habib Bourguiba. One of the rising leaders of the renewed nationalist movement that we spied on for a while, gathering intel about his doings and the networks he is linked to. He comes from the second generation of the Destour, an educated elite that fell in nationalism and that revived the national movement. Well, he is now at the head of the cortege of the protest that took off in Tunis today. Rassembling numerous nationalist leaders, from small subversive groups to clandestine unions and benefiting from our lenient policy they managed to rally hundreds of people to their cause and are now protesting as a provocation in the middle of Tunis!\nAgain the behaviour of the Bey was strange, how come he didn't even hear about this when his servants tell him anything about what happens in the city? He is suspect but he helped us before, could we give him our confidence?\nThis was anyway a fool move from the nationalist forces as they will be crused by our repression."
nfa.142.a:0 "Crackdown on it ourselves."
nfa.142.b:0 "Ask the Bey to make it stop!"
nfa.142.c:0 "Just ignore it."
nfa.143.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.143.d:0 "The Bey, confronted by our Resident-General refused to crackdown on the protest, he refused to give the order to fire on Tunisian civilians, as illegal as the protest might be. This refusal greatly angered the most high-ranking representatives of France in Tunisia and calls for an increased pressure on the Bey have arisen. This anyway won't prevent us to destroy this movement ourselves."
nfa.143.a:0 "Warn the Bey about his obedience and crackdown on the protest!"
nfa.143.b:0 "This was the last warning, ask him to step down."
nfa.143.c:0 "Back down..."
nfa.144.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.144.d:0 "Great News! The Bey isn't as corrupt by the nationalist ideology as we thought and agreed to repress the protest, he seemed visibly angered of it happening in his capital and this makes us hope for a more constructive relationship in the future."
nfa.144.a:0 "Good."
nfa.145.t:0 "Incident in Tunisia"
nfa.145.d:0 "An incident between the French authorities and Tunisians occured today, a disagreement over the respect of a law led to an increased tension that degenerated in a street fight. The Tunisian was probably fuelled by nationalist sentiments that are slowly spreading through the population."
nfa.145.a:0 "Unfortunate."
nfa.146.t:0 "National France beat us!" #White peace ai event
nfa.146.d:0 "You're not supposed to see that event, please report it if you do."
nfa.146.a:0 "Go back to our desert."
nfa.147.t:0 "Tunisia is victorious!"
nfa.147.d:0 "The damn Tunisians who rose up against our regime have managed to push back our armies and are now dangerously threatening our hold on North Africa. Our defeat is unquestionable, it may be time to ask for peace, a shameful as it is."
nfa.147.a:0 "Ask to meet the Bey for peace."
nfa.147.b:0 "We'll never surrender to colonials!"
nfa.148.t:0 "Tunisia is victorious!"
nfa.148.d:0 "The glorious lead of Moncef Bey was successful and the French are now crawling to our feet for peace. Will we be magnanimous and settle for the entire liberation of the Protectorate or should we destroy them completely?"
nfa.148.a:0 "We accept their offer."
nfa.148.b:0 "The French shall be destroyed entirely."
nfa.149.t:0 "Tunisia accepted our offer"
nfa.149.d:0 "The Bey accepted our gracious offer for the liberation of the Tunisian protectorate and we now have to make this agreement effective."
nfa.149.a:0 "Shame devours France."
nfa.150.t:0 "French invasion of Morocco!"
nfa.150.d:0 "Following the collapse of the once great German Empire, and our newfound independence, the French in Africa have taken it upon themselves to demand from us our territory, or risk facing war. What say we?"
nfa.150.a:0 "We've no choice but to surrender..."
nfa.150.b:0 "We shall fight to the end!"
nfa.151.t:0 "The Moroccans have resisted!"
nfa.151.d:0 "Foolishly, it seems as though the Moroccans have decided to snub our demands and will not be giving us our rightful territory. This is an act of aggression against France, and must surely be dealt with at once."
nfa.151.a:0 "Unfortunately, we are not yet ready for war..."
nfa.151.b:0 "It is time to attack!"
nfa.152.t:0 "The Return of Haute-Savoie"
nfa.152.d:0 "In the violence and confusion that followed our retreat to Africa, French land in Haute-Savoie had fallen under the protection of the Swiss government. Now that we have returned, it is time to consider re-establishing our territorial integrity and demand the return of these French posessions."
nfa.152.a:0 "Demand Haute-Savoie returned."
nfa.152.b:0 "We have more pressing concerns."
nfa.153.t:0 "France Demands Haute-Savoie"
nfa.153.d:0 "A point of contention between the Commune of France and us has always been the fate of Haute-Savoie. We took control of the region in order to protect it's mandated neutrality during the reign of the Syndacalists in Paris. Now that the legitimate government has returned and is demanding its return, now may be time to relinquish our control."
nfa.153.a:0 "France will have Haute-Savoie."
nfa.153.b:0 "We can't risk angering the government in Paris."
nfa.153.c:0 "Haute-Savoie will remain in our posession."
nfa.154.t:0 "Switzerland refuses our demand!"
nfa.154.d:0 "By all rights Haute-Savoie is French. Whatever reasons the Swiss have for rejecting our demands are without merit. We must decide how to respond to this assault."
nfa.154.a:0 "Perhaps Switzerland should keep it."
nfa.154.b:0 "Sever Diplomatic ties and embargo them."
nfa.154.c:0 "To war!"
nfa.155.t:0 "Joining the legitimate French government"
nfa.155.d:0 "Our recent liberation from our oppressive overlord raises the question of the goal of the existence of our country. Started as a satellite in an occupied France, we now have full power over our land but not much use for it. Near us lays the National government of France that descends from the legitimate government of the Third Republic and claims ownership of our controlled territory. A lot of our citizens also look forward to this other government and do not understand why we are making a satellite state last. Should we join with National France or should we declare ourself a legitimate authority on the region?"
nfa.155.a:0 "Ask National France for an union of our states."
nfa.155.b:0 "We are the only legitimate power in France."
nfa.156.t:0 "The French meet the French"
nfa.156.d:0 "The former French puppet government in Paris has been recently liberated and, following a new foreign policy, decided to consider us the rightful French government and ask for an union of our authorities. We are obviously very happy to hear that and hope Frenchmen will continue rallying together."
nfa.156.a:0 "Hurrah!"
